[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*With the death of [[Mbakena]], the political climate in Ravhava begins to shift. During his regency, Mbakena showed how successful the tribes could be when they collaborated, however some detractors of his always criticized his insistence to maintain the nomadic tradition of the Ravhavans. So called "burghers" pointed out how other nations had greatly grown in power and stability after settling down, and how the most sedentary of the tribes, the [[Eneb]], had been able to grow in population and technology much faster than the others. The main opponents to the burghers came from the [[Elh]], as nomadism allowed their trade routes to be constantly busy and with no short supply of people ready to travel. Another vocal opposition was from across all the tribes, especially the [[Ogol]], who pointed out that the ravhavan faith held the sanctity of nomadism and travel in very high regard. The back and forth continued to grow over Mbakena's rule and at his passing both sides immediately moved to work on [[Emira]]. Eventually she would come to a compromise, committing a vast amount of wealth to funding the development of urbanization infrastructure and encouraging settling into the existing settlements as well as founding new ones, especially deeper into the desert and along the coast, rather than along the mountains which are already quite populated. She also commits to supporting the Elh and [[Ibni]] in expanding westwards, establishing a larger area for the nomads to work, connecting settlements efficiently. All tribes seem happy with this, and Emira's husband [[Lev]] begins speaking with the Ogol elders to create settlments further west for the rapidly expanding tribe with no home.*
