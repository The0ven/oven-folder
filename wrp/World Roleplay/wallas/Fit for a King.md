"My liege, please try and pay attention, this is important. Your safety is paramount to the future of the realm and we cannot have you sneaking off into the city every night. I do not mean to scare you but your life is in serious danger if these actions continue..."

*The words rang empty in [[Lucius Rufinius]]' ears. He sighed, looking out the castle window longingly as his pedagogue, lecturing him for sneaking out once again. He was sitting up in the windowsill and refused to turn back to meet the ward's eyes. The night before he'd snuck out into the city of [[Tarkin]]. He was being kept in the summer palace by his court as he was nearing maturity, where he would ascend to the throne of [[Awalentse]]. He'd been protected closely ever since the [[Tusc Accord]] and the collapse of Valente, so he was used to the overbearing attention of his court. He'd grown more adventurous with age however, and now the palace guards could not contain his spirit. At first he was sneaking out every night, slipping out the servant's entrance and taking the road around the oasis towards the city. One night he was caught by one of the tutors who had stayed late and after that guards were posted nightly outside his bedroom. So he'd taken to sneaking out his window while creating a burrow beneath his bed to hide various spoils of his explorations. His train of thought was rudely interrupted by the tutor slamming his fist down onto the tabled between them.*

"DAMMIT! LISTEN! Your life is at risk. There are forces everywhere who would see it that you never reach the age of maturity and ascend the throne. They are motivated by their own selfish interests, we are motivated by your personal safety. If you continue to sneak out we will be forced to barricade you in your room. I know you do not want that, and neither do we."

*Lucius huffed, no, he did not want that of course, but he could not stand to be cooped up any longer.*

"Fine, I promise I will stay in. It's only a few weeks until my ascension I suppose..."


*About a week later, Lucius was sitting in his windowsill again, it just barely cracked open, and looking out at the town across the oasis to the town. He saw a horse ride up, not uncommon. Likely a message from somewhere else in the kingdom. Then, he saw two carriages arrive. One a deep verdant green and the other the recognizable red and grey of the Ravhavan Consul. He jumped down from the window, walking through his room and pulling on his royal attire. He was excited, the arrival of the carriage meant [[Tchankh]] was here. He had not seen the old consul for some time, and he looked up to the man like a father.*

*Lucius crept down the stairs, draped in dark red robes crossing his body diagonally to form a solid wrap. He had pulled his golden sash, around his waist and adorned his head with the princely crown. He crouched down slightly as he came to the bottom floor, listening out for the old man's voice. He heard his ward speaking with Tchankh, and another man, a voice that he could not quite place. His tutor spoke first:*

"The prince's safety is our utmost concern, this is truly dire news. But he is insolent, we can only do so much and he still has that rebellious childlike spirit, not unlike you [[Tsawb]]..."

"If the boy is like me he will make the finest of kings, the guild has faith in the monarchy, but my sources inform me that your holdings along the coast may... not be as secure as you think Tchankh. These coming days will be pivotal, the earlier we can reverse the tide of whatever is to come the better."

"Yes, we are concerned about the loyalty of some forces, especially in [[Jersan]], that of course being the reason the prince is here now and not in the capital. Look, right now we have the advantage that the magistrate does not know we know of his plans, and we should keep it that way. I have contacted several friends, indicating that allegiances may become strained in the coming week but that we must stay strong and united under the throne. Your men are a valued asset to us Tsawb but we cannot agree to just let you take charge in those cities."

"Oh, you've contacted the nobles have you? Well, surely you are fine then, my aid is not needed. Be honest Tchankh, how many nobles have really responded in favour of the monarchy?"

*By this point Lucius had reached the bottom of the stairs and was silently peering past the final column, listening and watching the men. He saw Tchankh, grey hair peaking from beneath his silvery shawl. Beside him stood the man known as Tsawb. Lucius had heard stories of the man, both dreadful and delightful. He was from Ravhava but his influence had spread deep through the Awalentse state, sometimes tied to the ancient mythos of the Jackal society. He shuddered slightly, and swore he saw the man make slight eye contact with him before he spoke again to the other two men.*

"We both know the nobles outside of the north are torn between you and the magistrate. If these rumours are true and we are on the edge of this all boiling over then we have a limited amount of time to really figure out where our true allegiances lie. Our people in Jersan, [[Burlingam]], [[Amzon]], and the trade posts outnumber even the monarchy forces, they will have no problem taking control. Not to mention, the people see us as economic angels, we are singlehandedly responsible for many of the rebuilding efforts after the war. Those efforts are not forgotten easily."

"Fine, you make a good point. I am sure of my contacts in the north and in Jersan, but I do worry our forces in the capital will be evenly matched with the Magistrate's loyalists. We of course control the palace as well, and the city is loyal to the prince. The [[Rek]] [[uLumua]] has committed to support the monarchist force and act as a neutral arbiter in the regions where their forces outnumber out own. Overall, the outlook is not as grim as it may first seem. That is, as long as you can keep the prince under control..."

"Y-yes sir, I apologize, but as I said it has become increasingly difficult. Perhaps if you could reside in the palace for some time? You know how much he respects you..."

"Have you not been listening? We are on a precipice! I love the boy but I am needed across the state! I-"

*As Tchankh was speaking a fourth man burst through the doors. This was not a regal officer like the other three, but a messenger. He yelled out:*

"SIRS, SIRS, PLEASE, A MESSAGE!"

*The three men swiveled, and Lucius crept closer as their backs turned to him.*

"The Grand Magistrate of the Valente State, [[Vedius Dalmaticus]], has announced the prince of Awalentse, Lucius Rufinius, is a bastard and ignoble. As such, the prince's claims to the throne are nullified. The Magistrate, as the highest appointed officer of the land, has announced his own ascension as lord of the realm."

*Lucius felt his stomach drop. His vision blurred and he stumbled forwards. The three men all turned at the noise behind them, and watched as the prince fell to his knees and collapsed to the cold stone before them...*
