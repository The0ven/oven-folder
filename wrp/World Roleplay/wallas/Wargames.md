[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*As empires all around the Ravhavan Union continue to grow, the army too has grown in response. Ravhavan home defence has always been the priority of the [[Ibni]] and now of the armed forces at large. However, prioritizing home defence must not make way to the stagnation of our military. To combat this the [[Rek]] has ordered for the standard forces to visit the Ibni homelands deep in the western desert near the Valente border to train with the Ibni troops. Training will consist of two phases, first a series of exercises focusing on each unitâ€™s form of combat. The Ibni will act as teachers helping soldiers to improve their skills in archery, sword fighting, horse riding, and hand to hand combat. The second phase will allow the soldiers, officers and troops alike, to put their new combat skills to the test. The army will be divided up into two teams, each mimicking the Ravhavan command structure and composition. Then the two armies will be given different objectives to complete, battling against eachother over different "towns" constructed from mud bricks in the desert. These wargames will function completely as a real war, but soldiers will use prop weapons made of wood so as to not cause real injury. Professional cartographers are conscripted to design the simulated battlefields and create maps and miniatures for the general staff to use in these games.*
