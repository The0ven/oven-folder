*[[Mbakena]] has grown old, seeing the tribes rise to great prominence during his reign, from the great accomplishments of architecture to the new discoveries of the metalworkers and miners to the explosion of wealth from the silver and gold trade to the expansion and development of the army. All has come together under his guidance and the entire tribal council respects his will as he is revered by his people. However, no tale continues forever and Mbakena knows his time is coming. In tradition with Rahavan culture, he embarks on a journey with the greatest caravaners of the [[Elh]] tribe. They will travel from the southernmost border with the Iturime empire all the way to the trading harbour say on the border with Velenkia, stopping at many settlements to say a final farewell to the tribespeople. With him travels Ilta; his wife, [[Lev]]; his son in law and leader of the [[Ogol]], Itab; leader of the [[Ibni]], and [[Mvata]]; leader of the Elh and head of the royal caravan company. Eneb; the leader of the mountainous [[Eneb]] tribe has made plans to join the caravan in the capital city nestled in the mountains precisely halfway between north and south. Over the course of the journey Mbakena addresses the caravan, the tribal council, and various village populations as they pass through. The topics range from personal to international and he connects all his achievements and experiences as leader with the values and religious tenets of the Ravhavans to form a foundational philosophy for the people. These dialogues are recorded by Lev, who often also participates in discussion and debate with Mbakena. The records will later be inscribed within a great mausoleum built for Mbakena and will also be compiled into a treatise on governing and life, entitled [[Rohini ve Filu]] (Meditations at the End). When Mbakena finally reaches his destination, a ceremony takes place; Mbakena kneels at the entrance to the mausoleum with his wife beside him. His daughter [[Emira]] and Lev who were inside descend the steps to meet them and kneel with the couples know facing eachother. Mbakena lays down an ornate rug spun with golden silk, a symbol of the Elh. Then he lays down a small curved knife with a ruby set in the hilt, a symbol of the Ibni. Next he removes the wooden ring suspended around his neck by a rope, a symbol of the Ogol and the Ravhavan faith. Finally he removes the gold band from his headdress, a symbol of the Eneb. Setting all these down atop the rug, his daughter collects them and returns to the inner sanctum of the mausoleum with her father, mother, and husband. After his ascension into the mausoleum Mbakena is tended to by [[Blind Sisters]] of the Ravhavan faith, preparing him for his death. The three stay with him night and day as he eventually slips further and further away until one evening he passes in his sleep. On his passing a large brazier atop the mausoleum is set, signalling the first in a series of braziers dotting the caravan route south to be set notifying the people of the passing. The new leader, in this case the princess Emira dons the crown, blade, ring, and rug and begins a journey back south to complete the long ritual. Upon arriving in the city on the southern border Mbakenaâ€™s soul is thought to finally be at peace.*
