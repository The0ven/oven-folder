[[_Ravhavan Union]]

The [[Eneb]] are in a way, the progenitors of the Ravhavan Tribes. The city of [[Nkhana]] is so old, no one truly knows when it was founded and when the four tribes came together, the city was chosen as the site of negotiation and the new capital city. The Eneb have always been and will always be sedentary, acting now as waypoints along the long and arduous desert journey, supplying water, food and tools to the caravaners of the [[Elh]] and weapons to the [[Ibni]]. The Eneb also mine out the large Hneka mountain range providing iron for tools, weapons and armour, and silver and gold for trading. When the current Eneb dies and Eneb is without a leader, five adolescents are selected through a series of tests to go through the selection ritual. The five abandon their names and past lives, setting out as a lone group to travel through seven gates, representing the rise of the original Eneb, founder of Nkhana. Throughout the trials the five learn the values of the tribe and on completion of the journey they must unanimously elect one among them to become the next Eneb. Today, [[Mbakena]] stands proud, flanked by Eneb and [[Lev]], staring up at scaffolding covering the face of the desert mountain in front of them. Work on a grand monument to the tribes is underway, a gateway to a chamber holding the greatest achievement of the [[Ogol]], the long count. The long count represents a unified calendar for the tribes, pushing forward thousands of counts, towards infinity.
