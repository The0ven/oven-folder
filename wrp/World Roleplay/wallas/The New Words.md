"AAARGH" *[[Neung]] screamed in pain as hot sand seared his back. A long rope of the stuff whipped back from striking him. He ducked out of the way just in time to avoid a column of sand extending from above him. All around him, sand was swirling with water. [[Haghba]] stood facing him, his eyes aglow as he channeled his mental energy into controlling the flows. They were training together, simulating the possible strategies they could use to gain an upper hand against [[Ngtsu]].*

"This isn't working. We go around and around with you wearing me down physically while I do nothing but try to avoid your attacks as long as possible. And you aren't even a god. If I can't fight you how could I ever hope to fight Ngtsu!"

*Neung huffed, fed up with this futile exercise. He felt he was going mad, doing the same thing again and again with no change. Haghba nodded, and dropped the manifestations.*

"Alright, we should take a break for tonight. But remember, this is not the dreaming. I have been here for many years and learned the secrets this realm holds. Ngtsu has no knowledge of such things."

"What do you mean? A god cannot be weakened like that can it? Just through coming here?"

"Not exactly, there is another step I have been working on. It's too early to explain. I just hope everything will be ready for us in time. Trust me, this is the only way."

*Neung sighed, accepting Haghba's vague explanation. He'd grown used to the prophet's love of mystery over the past week. Haghba had never explained why he never explained anything, which Neung felt was fitting. Neung walked with Haghba through the labyrinthian library, mazes of shelves leading back to the central area with the desk. Haghba relaxed against one of the bookshelves, and Neung lay down on the ground, staring up at the constantly blue sky and watching the clouds go by. The time for his confrontation with Ngstu was nearing, he could feel it...*

*It was early morning, or at least felt like it. Haghba had told Neung that time did not play out linearly in [[Guhl]] but every now and then he could still feel his body trying to mimic the need for rest. This morning he was tired, as if he had overslept and was having trouble activating his mind. Haghba was sitting on one end of the desk, his back turned to Neung, writing something into a new book. Nueng stood up, looking around the clear space until his eyes suddenly locked on to a book on the shelf. He shook his head, confused, but it seemed as if the book was almost... whispering to him. The cover pulsed and squirmed as if alive, its deep red colour almost glowing to Neung's eyes. He walked forwards, eyes fixed on the book. At first it had been far up the shelf, but as he approached he noticed it was now directly on eye level. Transfixed, his hearing sounded like he was underwater; therefore he did not hear Haghba yelling at him. His arm outstretched as if guided by a divine force, his muscles **flowing** like sand towards the book. As he touched it he felt energy **flow** through his body and he wrapped his fingers around the cover and pulled.*

*It was as if he'd removed a single stone from a dam holding back the entire [[Khetsi desert]]. A torrent of sand rushed from the hole and with it more sand poured from ever corner of the infinite library. The halls of bookshelves were filled, sand continued pouring as books fell from their places and were consumed by the torrent. Neung dropped the book and as it fell the pages **flowed** from one to the next, before landing on one page. Written in massive letters spanning across both pages was a name. Ngtsu:*

/ 

*The rushing sound was deafening. Neung knelt on the floor, his head pressed to the wood and his hands clasped over his ears. His eyelids were so tightly shut they were sore. His jaw was clenched so tightly he felt as though his teeth would crack. He tried to silence everything around him but a hissing, booming, voice permeated everything, as if projected from within his head and all around him.*

"AND HERE I WAS THINKING YOU HAD SOME MORAL FIBRE TO YOU. BUT YOU RAN AND HID THE SECOND YOU WERE FREE FROM MY GRASP. YOU SCATTERED LIKE A TERRIFIED INSECT. AND WHO DID YOU RUN TO? YOUR FALSE GOD! LIKE A SCARED CHILD TO A PARENT! BUT THIS TIME HE CANNOT PROTECT YOU! YOU CHALLENGE A GOD AND WILL SEE WHAT THAT MISTAKE COSTS - BOTH OF YOU!"

*Neung felt himself forced to right his upper body, now kneeling. His eyes opened forcefully and his hands were pulled from his ears by Ngtsu. He stared at the mass in front of him. Swirling blurs of liquids clashed much faster than when he'd seen the god in the dreaming. It was as if he could see the anger made physically manifest in the pulsing of the bulb. He realized Haghba was off in his peripheral vision, laying on the floor limply as if unconscious. Neung felt his stomach churn, rising in his throat as he realized he now had to face a god alone. Although the pressure on his shoulders was nigh overwhelming, he managed to lift one leg, pressing down and forcing himself to his feet. His hands balled into fists, he ducked slightly and faced off against the god.*

"I didn't run, I forced you to. I defeated you once, this time I wont show mercy."

*The sand began to hover off the ground, whirling around the room. Each grain vibrated violently, moving with the same intensity of the central mass of the god. It circled, forming a ring around the edges of the space, then expanding up and down to form a sphere. Soon, Neung was unable to even see the bookshelves. Instead he saw nothing but sand, the flowing sands forming a wall. Neung had to squint as the grains blew off the denser edges, reminding Neung of the sandstorms near [[Ves]]. He though back of home, Ravhava, [[Name]], the [[Ghuners]], [[Tchyen]], and of course [[Lua]]. He missed everyone deeply, even though it had only been about a week it felt like an entire lifetime. He thought of the sand storms again, the way that the people had harnessed their energy to power the steel works of the [[Ibni]]. This gave him hope, he channeled the energy flowing around him and his face rose again, his hand which had been shielding it dropping back. He faced the god again.*

"You do not scare me. You will never scare a soul again. Your reign of terror is over. I will defeat you not in the name of [[Ngok]] and [[Klah]] but in the name of my people, in the name of Ravhava, and in the name of Haghba."

*A rope of sand shot out towards Neung from the wall, and the muscle memory he'd built training with Haghba kicked in. He leaned back, allowing it to pass him and hit the swirling mass, where it simply was absorbed. The voice shot back:*

"It seems you have learned some tricks. I will admit that hiding here was smart, but it will not be enough to defeat me. I gave you a choice to join me and I will show you why rejecting it was the worst decision you have ever made in your sad lonely life. No one crosses me twice and lives to tell the tale. But for you, death will not come easily. No, I have something far worse in store for you..."

/

*Sand whipped towards Neung, forcing him to duck. It grazed his shoulder and he felt the rough grains sting his bare skin. Wincing in pain he bit down on his lip and steeled himself against the pain. Two arms reached out from the sand, hands grasping at his arms but he stepped to the side and drove his hand through the wrist, causing the sand to fall limp to the floor. The attacks became more frequent, as if the god was losing patience. At first, Ngtsu was toying with him but now they were attacking with fervor and anger borne from eons of spite against the Gods and ideals Neung represented. Neung continued to dodge the swipes of sand, his body almost moving on its own as he weaved between the attacks. He focused on what he could do next, stalling would only work so long. As he thought, he noticed the walls of sand begin to contract slowly, drawing his space in and limiting his movement. He knew his time was counted now in minutes. He thought back to the Chak Awr, wishing he was in the dreaming so he could just speak the god away, but also knowing that was only a temporary solution and he needed to truly end this now. He felt the swirling wall of sand begin to brush against the edges of his robes, picking at the threads. He knew there had to be something he could do, Haghba must have had a plan. Wait, that was it. Haghba had written in the [[Klim Chak]] about the power of Ravhavans. They had inherited the powers of Klah, the Chak Awr was simply channeling that in the dreaming. He hoped this would work, it was his last option. He spoke to the god with confidence:*

"You will never strike me down. You are no god. You are a pitiful entity feeding off fear and faith. Even if I do not end you here someone will, someday. Your time will come one way or another. Your fate. Is sealed."

*Neung's words boomed with the same intensity as Ngtsu's had when it entered Guhl. The flowing slowed, the advancing inwards halting.*

"What- what is the meaning of this. You cannot be doing this. I am a god. Your power cannot ever hope to match mine!"

*The god stuttered, confused as to how its strength was being sapped by this single human. A whooshing sound filled the room, and a familiar voice comforted Neung:*

"He alone may not be a god, but you gods receive your power from our faith. When we have no fear you cannot instill fear. You are beholden to us, not the other way around. Your fate. Is sealed"

*The flowing mass froze. Neung peered around it to see Haghba standing, his jaw clenched and his arms spread as if inviting the god to attack him. Neung smiled, He had almost forgotten the prophet was on the floor and he had not noticed him rising. He saw Haghba's mouth begin to move but the voice he heard did not come from the mouth, but rather from inside Neung's own head.*

"Close your eyes."

*Neung trusted him, and shut his eyelids. After a moment his eyes opened to a darkened room. Immediately he recognized the glowing lines spreading along the rough hewn rock walls. He saw [[Kuex]], [[Hugn]], and the other [[Ghuners]]. Kuex stood and spoke to him.*

/

"We are with you Neung, with you every step. Tchyen was able to contact Hugn with word from the prophet, saying you needed help. We do not really understand what is happening, but we have faith in you and Haghba to overcome Ngtsu."

"But, how am I here? How can I speak wi-"

*Neung stopped. His voice was not his. He looked down to his hands, he was sitting cross legged but his hands were older, smaller. He looked back up to Kuex, who smiled.*

"Well... I cannot really explain it, but somehow Tchyen has been able to... commune with you and Haghba. The both of you have... possessed her mind and spoken with her mouth and seen with her eyes... as you are now. She says as soon as she noticed you were gone she searched the entire dreaming for you, but found no one. She waited there for you for days, until suddenly Haghba appeared to her. He explained somewhat what was going on and that he was only able to enter the dreaming from Guhl as long as he was unconscious. She awoke with him residing in her mind, and came here to explain to us what had happened. So we gathered together in the [[Cave of Ghun]] to do our part against the threat of Ngtsu."

"I- I cannot thank you all enough for what you are doing. I had almost accepted my fate at Ngtsu's hands, but now I can feel her weakness. Now I must return to end this. When you see me next everything will have changed..."

*With that Neung was back, brought back almost into the exact second he left. He felt as though his soul had been flung back into his physical form, causing him to stumble forwards. He looked up at the flowing mass before him, shifting liquids mixing together. The flow has slowed to near freezing, like honey or ichor. He smiled. He felt his hand raise, allowing his body to move informed only by intuition. He drove his palm into the mass, and it burst, spraying blood, water, sand, and other fluids everywhere. Neung and Haghba shielded their eyes and as he dropped his arm and looked he saw something unexpected.*

*Before him was a form, humanoid mostly, but with an aspect to the skin that was almost incomprehensible. It was as if the body was not solid, but rather every part of it flowed in every direction. Neung saw how the texture on the figure's surface was never quite the same, as if it was simply a constrained view of something much larger flowing through the viewport. He knew this must be Ngtsu, although he was unsure what this form meant. Both men stepped forth, standing over the being. It raised its arms, shielding itself from their gaze.*

"Please, you have done enough. Please have mercy on me. Spare me today and I promise I will never forget. I am filled with regret, overflowing with feeling. Please save me from thy own wrath. Please..."

"Worry not Ngtsu, we do not intend to destroy you."

*Neung looked over to Haghba, who was now crouched down beside the figure's head. He was shocked, why would the prophet say these things? Did he truly mean that he had no intention of striking down the god here? Before Neung could say anything, Haghba continued.*

"Neung, come here, help her to stand. If we refuse to aid our enemies after defeating them we deserve not the faith of the people any more than them. She has begged for our help. You cannot seriously be considering the other option..."

*Neung though of all the pain Ngtsu had brought into his life, how close he'd felt to death. Then he though of everything else that had changed in the last month, how he'd found meaning and purpose for the first time ever. He shook his head, crouching down and interlinking his hand with Haghba behind Ngtsu's back, lifting her into sitting position.*

/

"No, you are right as always. Ngtsu, you are safe."

*The words almost stung to say, but Neung did mean them. Ngtsu leaned her weak body against a bookshelf, steadying as if unsure how to operate in this form.*

"Thank you both. I- I do not know what overtook me. I felt completely justified, my hatred fermented in my mind for... well forever. I am unsure when, if ever, I will be able to return to my true for, it seems these constraints of a mortal figure have been imposed on me for the foreseeable future. If there is anything you wish for, I can do my best to complete it."

"The only thing we ask of you is to work with the other gods. You all taught us mortals that we must work together to grow, but you do not practice this yourselves. Together the gods could be so much greater than the sum of their parts. You are our guiding lights, we follow you as your flock, but as you know best we also give you your power. Never forget your responsibilities again, or we will not be so forgiving."

*Neung nodded as Haghba spoke, and Ngtsu steadied itself, nodding as well. Once the prophet had finished, Ngtsu placed her hands on each man's shoulder and closer its eyes. Neung watched as the structure around the fluid lost its strength, like a bowl of water losing its surface tension, and the liquid flowed in reverse up towards the sky. Ngtsu was gone from Guhl.*

*Haghba and Neung were slumped on the floor of the library, surround by toppled shelves, splayed out books, and - thankfully unmoving - sand. Haghba sighed, turning to Neung.*

"You must return now, the battle is won. You have much more life to live before you will return to the library. But before you go, we must speak about you."

*Neung looked at the prophet, puzzled by this statement.*

"Alright, continue..."

"Your entire life you have been afflicted, or at least it was perceived as an affliction, to never be able to enter the dreaming. I am the reason you were never able to. I understand if you feel resentment towards me for this, but please allow me to explain. As I said before, I had a vision of a god rising up and knew I would need to seal myself away in this timeless crypt to survive long enough to battle this foe. While I was here I realized something else, I could not do this alone, nor could I do this with any normal mortal. Instead, I waited until I felt an immense energy bearing the same strength as I had. So I found you, Neung. Now I knew you would be a great soul, but was worried that the gods would be able to influence and weaken you in your early years. So instead I channeled the energy I could to block your spirit from entering the dreaming. I knew if your mind was never clouded during rest you could absorb so much more than anyone else, including I, ever had. And you have Neung, your mind surpasses any others, even my own. Although, I must say now that I do apologize. You were but an infant when I found you and to force you down this path without any choice was... selfish of me. I should have allowed you to thrive in your youth so you could make the decision yourself, but I was worried for the future of all mankind so I hope you can forgive me this one trespass..."

"I- I do not know what to say. Thank you I suppose, and of course. My whole life I felt different, outcast from dreaming as if even the gods did not want me. But I also felt driven, pushed forth by some divine wind to complete my destiny and discover. Your words are far too kind, but I do thank you for them."

/ 

*Neung felt choked by emotion, his entire life laid bare before him with an explanation he had never asked for. Although his words were kind he did feel the creep of resentment within him. Haghba was sorry, but the damage had still been done...*

"What will you do now? What will I do now? I am unsure as to how you plan for us to leave the Guhl, I suppose I had been thinking about it but forced myself to ignore the truth that we are... well... at least partly dead. How can we ever hope to return to the waking world?"

*Haghba smiled, a genuine warmth emanating from his face. In that moment Neung understood the power of this man, how he made those around him feel safe and loved, how he inspired their faith in him.*

"Well Neung, you are correct. We are partially dead and there is no way for us to truly escape Guhl while we are so. Rather, you must now go through the passages of the dead. I will protect your mind, allowing you to return to your body rather than be wiped of everything and reincarnated as normal. The way is just, *Through There*"

*Haghba's finger unfurled and pointed past the desk, which was sitting somehow protected from the sand as if it had blown the grains back from the delicate wood. It faced two bookshelves, which began to slowly shift apart like they were controlled by the pointing. A light emanated from between them, and Neung walked towards it involuntarily. He dug his heels in near the threshold and turned to Haghba:*

"But, if you are protecting my mind, how will you return? Who will protect the protector?"

"Oh Neung, you know the answer already."

*Haghba gestured around the library* 

"I've become used to all this and well, someone has to sweep all this sand..."

*Haghba smiled again, and Neung smiled back, their eyes meeting and a mutual understanding being reached. Haghba stepped forwards and sat at the desk, facing forwards to Neung and the threshold, and gestured for him to continue forwards. Neung stepped backwards, his back falling first into the light and his eyes closing...*

*Neung awoke in the windowsill of his room, Tchyen standing over him. He unfurled his body and hugged the member of the [[Blind Sisters]]. He thanked her for everything she'd done. After she left, Neung wandered around his room, thankful to finally be home and the entire ordeal to be over. Lua emerged from below his bed and Neung petted her back. She looked up into his eyes, and he could almost swear he saw an ethereal twinkle in the blackness of her iris. He thought back to seeing the cat while he was in Guhl and how Haghba had not known anything about the cat appearing there. Shaking his head he scratched the soft fur again, discarding the thought. He retrieved the [[Chak Awr]] from the windowsill and sat at his desk, returning the book to its place opened to the final written page. He was happy with his transcription of all of Haghba's work and it was time for a new venture. He took his quill, dipped it into his inkpot, and began to etch new words onto the page...*
