[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*The sun rose high over the village of [[Name]], its hot rays piercing through the cold mountain air. At this high an altitude the day was only hot for about three hours, before returning to a mild breeze. As [[Neung]] approached the great temple at Name, a grand building commemorating the birth of humanity from the stone of [[Puhl]], he removed the dark shawl from over his shoulder and wrapped it around his head. He could feel the sun's heat scorch his back and his sweat as it rolled down his neck and towards the belt on which his satchel hung. He steeled himself slightly and entered the foyer of the temple. He had come to the temple thousands of times, leading sermons and studying here everyday since he arrived in name some two decades ago. And yet, he never failed to be astounded at the beauty of the place. It jutted out of the cliff face with purpose, as if announcing its existence to the world. The dark reddish-brown columns and pointed top carved sat in place, carved into the mountain rather than from it. A small staircase led up to the grand doorway through which Neung now entered. The foyer was completely opposed to the rock hewn front. Adorned with glorious marble tiling, gold fixtures, and lit by large steel braziers sitting atop pillars of the mountain stone; it boasted a great opulence rare in the humble village. Truly a monument to the great mines and quarries of Ravhava, the temple was built on an old mining cave itself, which reached so deep into the mountain where no one dared venture during the days it was an active mine. Today, Neung swiftly walked through the foyer towards a large set of heavy wooden doors reinforced with steel hinges and shackles. He offered a few curt nods and smiles to the denizens of the temple, greeting worshippers politely as they milled about waiting for the next sermon. Out the corner of his eye he saw a new young monk being scolded by one of the [[Blind Sisters]], though he could not make out for what. He smiled to himself a little, while he was troubled at least his surroundings had not changed or caught on yet. He slowed from his brisk pace as he reached the doors and pushed them open, revealing a darkened room with a notable damp smell. Stepping in, he lit a few miniature braziers and quickly closed the doors, latching them shut with a small steel hook. He turned towards the room, and watched as the light from the braziers streaked up the rough hewn wall, revealing the room slowly as not a room at all, but a cave entrance, albeit one lined with bookshelves. A chill permeated the air of the cave, one not felt in the foyer, and as Neung began to walk down the winding shaft of the cave he returned the shawl to his torso after feeling his beads of sweat freeze to his body. As the tunnel narrowed Neung lifted his hand to feel the ceiling lower towards his head; He slowed his breath as the air became thin and cold enough that each breath felt as though tiny daggers were shearing down his throat and lungs. Eventually, the candle light completely died out. Now shrouded in complete darkness, hunched over with his shoulders pressing on the ceiling and walls, and barely breathing Neung trudged on.*

*After what felt like hours, the horrible tunnel let up. The first thing that changed was the air, suddenly Neung was able to breathe properly again and the air tasted almost sweet; as it often does early in the morning as it carries the smell of dew off the grass. Then came the light, slowly cracks of light formed at the end of the tunnel, shooting up the cavern walls as they began to finally let up and widen. Finally, he was through and as he stepped out into the ancient cavern so deep in the mountain he sighed with relief, tired from the arduous trek down. Sitting in front of him was a large round cavern, lit both by piercing rays of sunlight peering through fissures in the walls, and through one massive hole pushing up through the ceiling and opening up to form a massive crater in the top of the mountain. Branching out from the central hole and spreading like veins out across the ceiling and down the rounded walls were dark maroon and mustard crystal shapes, jutting out with sharp angles and refracting light across the room. Neung slowly strode down the steps, taking in how the room had changed since he'd last visited almost a year ago. The bookshelves once carved into the walls were bare, the books likely migrated out to the cave entrance for easier access. The floor was now scattered with books, wax, scraps of metal, and emblazoned with odd chalk symbols linking together in large round shapes. Neung's brow furrowed as he tried to understand the various inscriptions but gave up quickly, turning his head to a group of men kneeling hunched over a collection of trinkets and inscriptions at the far end of the room. He walked over to them and studied their robes, adorned with insignias on the backs and hoods, to decipher who was who. Noticing his presence, one of the figures stood immediately and rushed over to him, bowing his head to greet him.*

"Neung, it has been many long months since you have graced us with your presence. To what do we owe the honor of your grace appearing before us today.- Ach, where are my manners. I apologize, we are quite in the middle of something big and my brain is a mess. Please, come, join us and sit. Welcome back to the [[Cave of Ghun]], join us, join us, sit."

"Alright, [[Hugn]], calm down, do not worry your words trespass naught. Thank you for the warm welcome and yes, it has been too long since I have visited the [[Ghuners]]." *Following the prompting of the short old man, Neung squatted down, dropping one hand deftly to trace the sigils winding in a spiral.*"Wow, these almost appear as works of art. So what exactly is it you are working on here? I have in fact come here to discuss another matter but perhaps we should speak on this first?"

"Nonsense, tell us what troubles you Neung." *Another squatted figure spoke, this voice gravelly yet sweet, he recognized it as [[Kuex]], the leader of the Ghuners. Smiling to her he relents.*

"Alright alright, well last night I was having trouble reaching slumber, as always, and I decided to read from the [[Klim Chak]]. Well, I read through one section, reflected deeply on it, and as I was moving through a second section I felt my eyelids become heavy. I resorted to finishing the section before returning to my bed, as I was nearing the end, but I succumbed to the sweet embrace of sleep before I could. This alone is irregular, but perhaps in my older age I've become more tired from the life of high priest. However, when I slept, rather than the hours passing in an instant as they always do for me, I felt myself transported to a new realm. It was like falling into a hole that never ended, but also like being suspended in a thick ooze, almost like floating..."

*The Ghuners nodded in unison, then Hugn spoke up again.* "This is amazing news! This means your curse has finally been lifted. Oh thank heavens, you have peered for the first time. You were already such a great scholar of our faith, your knowledge and understanding of the Klim Chak deeper even than us gathered here. Now with your ability to peer finally open, you could rise to even the wisdom of the great [[Haghba]]! We must te--"

*Neung noticed several of the Ghuners shift uncomfortably at the mention that one might ever rival Haghba. Seconds later, Kuex interjected:* "Quiet now Hugn, your emotion betrays you. Remember your oath, our oath, to Haghba. We will carry on his teachings too troubling for even the [[Blind Sisters]], and we will do so quietly. The people must not find out about our affairs until it is time. Also, if Neung was as excited about this occurrence as you, would his expression not be less sour?"

*Neung blinked, now realizing his faced had been contorted with worry since this morning, and allowed it to relax. He breathed a deep sigh before continuing.* "Yes, I suppose I had not really even thought to be excited about this development but perhaps once my mind is settled and my worries resolved I will come around to see this as a gift. Unfortunately at the moment my situation is quite dire. As all of you know I've been the high priest of the Yucka for over a decade now, yes despite being unable to peer and struggling with even sleeping in the first place. Through all of this I've sunk as deep into the sacred texts as any of you, trying to learn more about my condition and learn to peer, or at least just sleep, properly. Unfortunately, as you all know, to no avail. The upside of this is that I, if I may be so bold, have become one of the most knowledgeable and spiritual figures in the entire Ravhavan Union. I have always felt in tune with the Gods and their creations and held a steely resolve when preserving my faith in Yucka. I cannot even truly believe I'm saying this and I hope you will all forgive me for being so shaky. When I was peering, my body felt stiff and I was unable to move yet moving almost involuntarily. I felt trapped and a strong sense of fear overtook me. I felt chills down my spine and then I heard it." *He pauses, swallowing the nervously reminiscing on the dream.* "I heard a voice, ethereal, deep, rough, and smooth all at the same time. Like a waterfall speaking yet also like wind blowing words into my ears. I was astounded, known this must be the voice of [[Ngtsu]] but shocked a god would directly address any human since the great tribal wars, especially one such as myself who would definitely recognize it. The experience itself was somewhat disturbing, but also serene in a way. No, what I am more worried from is what was said and what happened once I awoke. The voice told me welcomed me to the realm of dreams, but instructed me I was being held back by my physical form in that plane and I needed to relinquish physical control to allow my spiritual and mental power to thrive. That on its own is sensible, we have long known that the realm in which the gods dwell is not one of the physical and most who are new to peering must take time to learn the true power of it. However, its what I was told when I was awoken by the sweet sister [[Tchyen]]. She helped me out of my slumber quite urgently, she'd apparently rushed up the stairs after having a night of peering of her own. She told me during her sleep she'd seen me, bound but without bindings, thrashing about as if struggling against myself. But I myself have no memory of this, my body felt almost TOO still while I was peering. Considering what the voice said to me, I believe the good sister saw my physical body fighting with my mind. I feel very unsettled in this but again, that is not the worst of it. My main concern is about how it seems one of the gods approached me directly and tried to instruct me on peering. Why now of all possible times, what could be happening that we are not aware of. I am worried deeply that Ngtsu would so brazenly violate the covenant set in place by [[Ngok]]. I'm terrified friends, I am experiencing a complete crisis of faith..."
