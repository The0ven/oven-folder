[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*Days had passed since [[Neung]] had seen [[Ngtsu]] in the peering and his life had returned to normal, almost. He had tried his hardest to forget the confrontation but it would not leave his mind. His sleeplessness had returned, plaguing him every night, although part of him was grateful both for the return to something he was used to and that he was able to stay out of the dream realm. [[Tchyen]] had been checking on him multiple times throughout the day and watching every night for any presence of Ngtsu in the dream realm. Neung now sat in the same desk he did all those days ago when he first experienced the peering. He was reading through the [[Chak Awr]], the book propped open on a stand with his own notebook opened and near full. Surrounding him were stacks of books from Ravhava and beyond, including the [[Klim Chak]], the [[Rilgish Malgar]], and a large tome of [[Xie]] scientific and spiritual knowledge. He had been attempting to transcribe the Chak Awr nearly every second of the day and had been moderately successful, using his wide breadth of knowledge to cross reference entries with discoveries around the world and uncover even more than the [[Ghuners]] had been able to. Neung was disappointed to find that the book contained none of the writing telling stories of time, or that he could no longer influence the track of the story without the stroke of a pen. Instead, the tome was full of knowledge concerning things from religious ponderings to animal husbandry to the recipes for transmuting substances like he'd been shown by [[Kuex]].*

*He was so engrossed in his studies that he nearly jumped from his chair when he felt fur brush against his leg. He looked down to see [[Lua]], looking up at him with her big dark eyes and purring. He picked up the tabby and the Chak Awr and walked over to the windowsill, where he took some dried meat from a cupboard and placed it in the cat's bowl. Petting her back as she ate, he looked and into the starry sky and the few lights remaining on in [[Name]] outside. He could just barely see the flaming pyres at the temple entrance across the town. The night sky always brought him comfort, before because it made him feel hope that one day he would be able to peer far into the void as the other Ravhavans could. Tonight it settled his mind because he felt safety radiating from the shining white dots, the only thing keeping the sky from becoming just like that horrific black ooze of the dream realm. Neung became lost in the stars, his vision beginning to blur as he felt the warm arms of sleep begin to embrace him. He sat up on the sill and lay down, stretching out beside Lua, who curled up between his arms. As he drifted off to sleep he stared out, eyes and mind fixed on the inky blackness. The white dots began to fade gradually and Neung felt the stone of the nook slip away to a soft thick ooze...*

*Neung straightened and began to look around, eyes now fully open, feeling more comfortable in the dream realm than ever. Still, he could feel the hair on his back stand straight as he remembered the confrontation with Ngtsu the last time he was here. He looked down to his right hand and saw the Chak Awr there. As he opened it again the pages blurred like last time, opening to a fresh page. This time no text appeared. Instead, two words were emblazoned in the top left corner, almost glowing on the page:*

Section 0:
"FIND ME"
```

*Neung shut the book and looked around with frightened eyes, half expecting to see someone in front of him beckoning him forth. He stared into the darkness, his brow furrowing as he thought. "Find me". Find who? Or what? And how should he start? He could only think of one answer to the first two questions, but that was impossible. Instead, he refocused his efforts on the final, how. He knew it had to start with the book. He flipped it open again and found the words, once so strongly emblazoned, had faded. He saw the ticking of words appear again, the author's signature changing to what it once was. The book had reverted. For a moment he was unsure what to do, then he breathed deeply and considered all that had happened to him in the previous week. Knowing what he must do, he took a leap of faith:*

"Neung fell to the floor, dead, and awoke in the realm between lives."

*Pure sensation, floating, touched by nothing, every spot on his body vibrating, moving, interacting, colliding. Neung's entire body froze and went rigid in a second. His eyes shot open and the now familiar ooze of the dream realm was gone, replaced by a sprawling room, extending as far in every direction as Neung could see. Shelves lined with books, sculptures, paintings, and instruments shot up from the wooden floor; as Neung followed the one immediately in front of him he realised it did not end, at last as far as he could tell, and rather continued up into the air, where there was no roof but instead an open sky dotted with clouds. Fur brushed against Neung's leg and he looked down to see Lua. Shocked and confused at what was happening, Neung stared as the cat wandered off between two shelves, meowing at him as if beckoning. Following quickly in the cat's steed, Neung walked through the seemingly endless library but quickly became lost. He arrived at a small clearing of the shelves, a large desk placed at the centre with an inkwell and a giant tome open about halfway through.*

"Lua! Where have you gone my pet? Come out, I can't find you!"

*Neung called out for the cat, but only heard a feint meowing in return, from which direction he could not confidently say. He turned to look around and heard something new, a light patter of footsteps. The volume grew until a man walked into view. Neung audibly gasped, his leap of faith had not been in vain. He had found the author of the message in the book.*

"Hello Neung. I have been waiting for your arrival since the moment you were born. I hope you will excuse me, I had wanted to find you the moment you appeared in the library but you got out ahead of me. I never expected you to start wandering, although perhaps I should have." 

*A chuckle emmenated from the man in front of Neung. He was wrapped in a dark grey linen, folding over itself as it spiralled from the shoulder down the torso to his feet. His beard was shorter than Neung expected, and his head almost bald. Neung tried to speak, but for once no words could form on his lips. Instead he continued to stare, mouth partially agape, at the man.*

"I suppose you are confused, although I am sure not on the matter of my identity. Perhaps rather you are starstruck? Do not be, I promise I am much more boring than the stories have led you to believe. My legacy in Ravhava is something that has escaped me, and the truth, almost completely; although what man's legacy is ever truly defined by him. I suppose I should be grateful I am remembered so fondly, although I rather do wish it was with less reverence and more simple understanding."

/

*Neung closed his mouth, shaking his head slightly as he focused his mind. He finally spoke:*

"I apologise for my rudeness, I had thought it impossible anyone else could have possibly sent me that message in the book and yet I still find myself in awe at seeing you in the flesh. I have read and heard accounts of your life since I was but a small child, before I could truly even begin to understand what they meant, the [[Blind Sisters]] made sure I knew your name as soon as names could be known. So no, I am not confused when it comes to your identity, although I am extremely confused when it comes to everything else. Where are we, how are we here, how are you here, what is next, and most importantly, where is my cat?"

"Well, I'm not sure what you mean with your final question, but perhaps I may answer the others. We are in [[Guhl]], the afterlife, where our souls go after they shirk their mortal coil. We have arrived here through the same means, the Chak Awr. You see, the book is not truly mine, but a physical emanation of all the gods, perhaps especially [[Klah]]. I developed it during my study in the [[Cave of Ghun]], using my knowledge of the god of language to speak words that could control the domain of [[Ngtsu]], the flow of time. [[Puhl]] sets the events written into stone and [[Ngok]]â€¦ well she inspired everything about it. The book harnesses the power of Klah, which is within all of us, and allows us to channel it in the peering to perform miracles as Klah did. Control of the dream realm rests in those pages. However, the book is imperfect. When met with a paradox of life and death, the speaker inscribing their immediate death into the book, fate acts faster than the inscription. The speaker dies before their fate can be solidified and as such they are neither alive or dead. So they reside here in Guhl forever, unable to reincarnate or to elevate themselves to the point of joining the gods."

*Neung was completely stunned, his footing felt unsure momentarily as the realization of what he had done set in. At least, he thought, he was not dead completely. And at least before him stood the only man he knew could understand and aid him. Before him stood the first prophet, the greatest child, the mouth of the gods. Before him stood [[Haghba]].*

"But prophet, why did you resign yourself to this fate. All those decades ago on the beach in [[Knus]], you forsook Ravhava for this... realm of nothing... why?!"

"My friend, nothing has ever pained me more than what I had to do that day. When I was in [[Cach]], I saw a vision of what was to come. One of the child gods, Ngtsu, entrusted with the domains of flows. I saw her grow fed up and revolt, endangering the entire world. And I knew, another prophet would come, much greater than myself. Yet they would not be able to overcome a god by themselves. So I exiled myself to this plane, where I do not age. I chose imprisonment. These books around here you see, they are my translations of the tomes of the world, sprawled from lands Ravhava have never even heard of. They detail the fabric of faith and philosophy across the world. I write every day I am here in preparation for your arrival. And now you are here. As for what is to come, first you must sit. Tell me everything of your encounter. We do not have much time. Ngtsu will not wait for us to be ready..."
