*With the construction of [[THE SCINTILLIAN WALL]] underway, the current equipment used to defend fortifications seems lacking to protect such a large area. The ballistae used currently are slow to reload and prone to breaking. A new system is developed by an engineer from [[Ves]] named [[Nebe]]. This large piece uses two pentagonal gears connected by a chain and powered by hand crank, in combination with a funnel where bolts are piled in to wind the firing mechanism repeatedly without need for manual reloading. Once the funnel does eventually need replenishing bolts are bound by reeds so that the operator may place a bundle in the funnel and then pull on a tab to tear the binding and release the bolts. The Nebian bows are deployed first to the southern fortifications to protect them and will be placed within the newly constructed towers as the Scintillian Wall is built.*
