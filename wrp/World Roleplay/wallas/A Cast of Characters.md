Control: Northern territories are loyal to the king, ruled by various counts who support the monarchy; [[Tarkin]] (central city) is an Oasis, the Prince's palace is built there to keep him safe from the dangerous men in the capital until he is of age; Loyalist supporters in [[Jersan]] mostly within the keep.
