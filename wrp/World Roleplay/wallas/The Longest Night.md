[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*It has been some time now since the death of the great king [[Mbakena]] and the acension of his daughter, [[Emira]]. However, since her rise the leaders of the other tribes have stopped her at every turn from progressing their empire towards a new day. A veritable dark age for the tribes, very little of anything has happened. This period would later become known as "the longest night" as it is characterized by slow buildup and a complete stall of social progress. Villages slowly became towns, and bands became armies, but the relative landscape of Ravhava fails to change in any meaningful way. The major event of the era is the formation of a regional alliance from the Valente state.*
