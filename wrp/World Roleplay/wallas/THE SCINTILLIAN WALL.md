[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*The eastern threat looms large over the entire continent and although the Ravhavans are relatively safe behind the eastern mountains, the security of the nation is no guarantee. To protect the sovereignty of the union, [[Emira]] commissions the construction of a walll along the northern border of the empire. The wall will stand 12ft tall and 8ft wide. A skeleton constructed from wooden posts will be put up, then stones will be built up on either side. The construction will be undertaken by a combination of skilled masons from [[Eneb]], laymen from various tribes, military engineers from the [[Ibni]], and overseen by surveyors from the [[Elh]]. The wall is estimated to be completed in 4 years and all the stones will come from the mountainside adjacent to the easternmost point. There will be two large customs houses, one at the gate of the city of [[Knus]] and the other built into the mountain tunnel pasting through the western face of the [[Dragon's Spine Mountains]]. There will be guard towers every half mile with both guardsmen and mounted weaponry to defend the wall.*
