## 5th Mkanda of the 82nd Kneb
> [[Mbakena]] sits at the head of a table chiseled from stone, his worn hands resting on the cold rock. He looks over the five others sitting infront of him._ _To his right is Eneb, chief of the [[Eneb]], the most sedentary of the Ravhava tribes. They dwell in small villages dotted along the mountains, acting as stops for travellers where they can fill up on fresh mountain water and stay a night in a cooler enviroment. The Eneb also provide stone and metals for the other tribes, including the table they all sit at now._ _To his left is [[Mvata]], one of two women in the room and the leader of the [[Elh]] tribes, the most nomadic tribe in control of the majority of the trade. The Elh call no city home and instead embrace the desert as their home, using stacks of stones known as Khem to navigate the otherwise featureless terrain. The Elh are the only tribe with the knowledge to complete the full route from the Itruime to Velnekia._ _Past Mvata is Itab, the leader of the [[Ibni]] tribe, a mostly militaristic tribe who serve guards for the traders, the main ravhavan fighting force, and mercenaries who will fight abroad on behalf of the council. The Ibni weild lightweight spears as melee weapons, though they most commonly ride on camelback and attack their grounded enemies with slingers._ _Across from Itab sits [[Lev]], the leader of the [[Ogol]] tribe and the betrothed of Mbakena's daughter. The Ogol are a people spread throughout the other tribes, mostly as artisans and in specialized positions. The Ogol are the originators of the Ravhavan religion and therefore many are seen as more spiritual or enlightened by the other tribes. As such, the Ogol are mostly funded by donors to complete works of art, philosophy, or make scientific developments._ _Finally, sitting at the end of the table is Ilta, Mbakena's wife and second in command. Ilta is from the Elh tribe, and Mbakena the Ibni. Their daughter's betrothal to Lev cemented the longstanding alliance between the three tribes, with the Eneb more than happy to continue to work alongside them._ _Mbakena raises his head to dismiss the leaders. "I have much to think about, we will reconvene after the 83rd Kneb. Go now, be with your people." One by one they file out, leaving Mbakena and his wife to ponder the future of the tribes..._
