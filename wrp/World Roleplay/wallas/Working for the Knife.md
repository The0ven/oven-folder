[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*With the arrival of the Csarian troops to Ravhava, our preparations begin at once! [[Rek]] [[uLumua]] personally greets the [[Csarian Empire]]'s' General commanding their forces and they ride together, leading the caravan of Csarians to [[Ves]], the [[Ibni]] capital, where they will be training. Troops will train with the Ibni both to become much better acquainted with the desert terrain but also to better ingratiate with the Ravhavan forces improving morale and cohesiveness between the ranks.*
