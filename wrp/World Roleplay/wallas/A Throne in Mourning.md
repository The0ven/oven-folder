[[_Ravhavan Union]]
[[Stories]]

*After spending almost her entire life as leader of the Ravhavan Union, [[Emira]] Borey has passed into the realm of dreaming. A week ago, she announced she would begin her journey to [[Knus]], like her father [[Mbakena]] and the prophet [[Haghba]]. The procession was joined by citizens in the tens of thousands, some walking for a period and others just meeting her along the road she travelled from [[Nkhana]]. Her husband [[Lev]] accompanied her on the complete journey, and each of the council partook in a portion of the journey. Once the procession had finally reached the northern city, they were greeted by [[Mvata]] and other important figures in the union, including the [[Rek]], Eneb, and leader of the [[Ibni]]. The [[Blind Sisters]] welcomed the elderly woman to the grand mausoleum. Before she can finally resign to her fate, one final ritual must be completed...*

*[[Kuex]] stood among the other important mourners, and as Emira raised her head and made eye contact with the woman, she felt an energy coursing through her body. She was among some of the greatest people in the Union, but she was being called forwards alone. She looked left, to the large man standing besides her. [[Neung]] looked back at her and smiled, tilting his head towards the queen. Kuex stepped forwards, and mirrored the queen as she knelt on the stone. She watched as the queen unfurled the fabric wrapped around her waist, revealing a number of items that had been held against her torso. First, the queen placed down an ornate golden rug, entwined with stunning wave patterns in a deep blue. Mvata smiled, the symbol of her tribe, the [[Elh]] almost shining with beauty. Atop the rug, Emira laid down a small steel blade, curved slightly, with a shining ruby set in the hilt. The deep red signature of the Ibni reflected off the gem, sending stunning rays across the steel. Besides the blade she places a wooden ring, about the size of her palm. The wood was hand carved by an elder of the [[Ogol]], with tiny details inscribed within representing the genesis of the Yucka gods. Finally, Emira places a band of gold, impossibly reflective, around the two items. The Eneb nods, proud of his tribe's most prized artifact. Keux feels frozen in place, the weigth of the coming responsibility before her. She breathes deeply, focusing her mind, and collects each item in reverse order. Then, her and Lev enter the mausoleum with the queen to be with her until the end.*

*Six days later, Kuex is standing with lev atop the balcony of the Mausoleum. The man's expression is solemn, but as she meets his eyes he warms, extending his hand towards the great brazier before them.*

"It is time, go ahead..."

*Kuex approaches the brazier, pulling a torch from the stand before it, and lights the pool of oil. Moments after the flame bursts up, another off in the distance mirrors it. All the way down the road that Emira travelled braziers are lit in a chain following the reverse of Emira's journey, back towards Nkhana. Kuex dons the crown, blade, ring, and rug and walks down to the entrance of the mausoleum. There, she begins her lone journey to the capital, following the flame...*
