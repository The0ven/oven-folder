[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*A chill runs across the vast desert as the moon and stars twinkle down on [[Ves]], the homeland of the [[Ibni]] tribe. Although the animals have hidden away for the night, feet still shift the sands as the Ibni train their hardest in twilight. The Ibni are the youngest of the Ravhavan tribes, although their oral histories still trace the founding of the tribe back over two hundred years. In the center of the large desert city sits a complex designed to harden even the meekest of souls into brave warriors of Ravhava. Here in the Ves training grounds the clash of iron on wood is constant, only pierced by the occasional volley of arrows and clop of hooves. The Ibni train in many forms of combat ranging from unarmed to mounted archery, and always use live weaponry when training to best mimic the sense of a real battle. There is a monthly event in the training grounds where two teams are split up and march out to the large oasis west of the city, further into the desert where they then assign leadership and other roles before battling over control of the oasis in a mock battle for three days. Over these days the troops both young and old gain real tested battle experience so it is important to simulate a real war as closely as possible. There are also other events such as mock raids and mountain exercises in the domain of the [[Eneb]] that the warriors go through to become as well rounded as the terrain of the union. With a new threat looming in the east there has now come a time where the Ibni are no longer only needed as a defensive measure. Training has increased and recruitment opened up to the other tribes, voluntarily of course, to serve in the home guard while the Ibni's elite forces are sent east as expeditionary brigades. The industrious Eneb begin to shift their focus from trade goods and luxuries to doubling the production of military equipment including armor and weaponry. The expeditionary force will be formed from volunteers of the Ibni's most elite cavalry regiments, the warriors adorned with plated armor and the leaders bearing a large set of decorative wings on their back. These winged warriors are known as the [[Aiker Corps]] and are exceptionally skilled in both ranged and close quarters combat, mounted and unmounted, willing to fight the enemy all the way from a mounted archery position down to a unarmed melee. Training through a combination of high heat treks through the desert with few supplies and little water, as well as the frigid mountains where they hike for days with little rest before combat training at the peaks, where the air is thinnest. The corps gathers at [[Nkhana]] with volunteers from their allies the Valente and [[Csarian Empire]] states, forming a caravan east throught [[Mbakena's Passage]] into Khoakhram and along the Orra river throught anuva and Polonia towards the open plains of battle.*
