_By now, the sun was rising, and a crowd had gathered around the smouldering remains of [[Khuq]]’s homestead. Unusually, [[Tsawb]] had decided to leave the refuge of the inner city to witness the aftermath of the [[Ksugh]]’s strongly-worded “message”. Ksugh was already there, accompanying [[Khoch]] who was examining the remains for himself while downing a fresh beef wrap from the market. Upon realising Tsawb was there as well, he was taken aback. 
“Tsawb? Fancy seeing you here.” he exclaimed. 
“I had to see for myself. Very rarely does the business bring me pleasure like this.” Tsawb slowly replied. Ksugh grinned. 
“I’m happy you’re proud, boss. If you need any more messages sent, don’t hesitate.” This response elicited a slight chuckle from the boss. The three silently admired the chaos for a few moments as Khoch wolfed down the wrap.*

*This violent delight was interrupted by [[Bogh]] storming in to confront Tsawb. “What the HELL? A FIRE?” he shouted, pressing Tsawb in his chest." 
“Shut the fuck up. Everyone’s suspicious of the [[Grain & Livestock Guild]] already.” Khoch replied, the signature look of annoyance on his face. 
“Suspicious? No shit they’re suspicious. Everyone fucking knows it was us already. Who else could have done it?” Bogh said through his teeth, his tone subdued but still silently fuming. 
“You really should be more thankful, Bogh,” Tsawb said while he wrapped his arm around him, “since we’re simply looking out for you.” Bogh recoiled from the gesture, disgusted. 
“You can’t just murder whoever you want. Not only is this shit wrong, it’s going to tarnish our guild’s name. We don’t want to be known as murderers.” 
“Really? I think you need to open your mind. This could work quite well for us. I feel like it brings our name more… weight.” Tsawb replied.*

*Bogh was taken by disbelief. Tsawb continued, now addressing all three of his associates.*
_“Listen closely. I believe there are two mindsets in this world. The first one, the peasant, is intimidated by challenges which stand before him. The reason for this is that he does not think himself worthy of passing the challenge. For the peasant, attempting the challenge is something completely unnatural to him. He feels wrong just in the act of carrying it out. He expresses a desire to return to his natural, compliant state. But a king does not think like that. To the king, attempting the challenge is like entering one's home. You open the door because you know that the home is yours, and that you deserve to enter it. No... you MUST enter it, because your family would be lost without you. Even if the door was barricaded, the king persists in entering his home because he is entitled to it. So listen closely. This empire is my challenge. I intend to conquer it. Why do I do this? Because I fully believe that it is mine for the taking. The king's mindset. The king's mindset is my most terrifying ability, since it cannot be stopped.”

_After a few seconds, Khoch and Ksugh started clapping, while Bogh was still at a loss for words. He gathered his last shreds of fury for one more subdued outburst. “You won’t get away with this. I’m bringing it before the other guildsmen. You’re finished.” He promptly stormed off. Having seen enough, Tsawb too decided to stroll in the other direction. Left only were Khoch and Ksugh. 

_“What did you think?” Ksugh nonchalantly asked.
“Oh, it tasted like fucking heaven.” Khoch replied. 
“No, boss. The speech.” 
“Oh.” he said._

_“I think that door finally drove him insane.”_
