*The air in the [[Cave of Ghun]] was suddenly thick. As [[Neung]] spoke, he did not notice his voice raising, its pace quickening with his fear. By the end he was near shouting, his hands shaking and tears leaking from his face. The monks were silent for a moment after he uttered those final words. [[Kuex]] was the first to speak.*

"Neung. You are a great theologian, maybe the best since [[Haghba]]. To live this long in such a spiritual way and never encounter something that scares you or forces your faith into question is rare if not impossible. That being said, what you have told us here today is deeply troubling. Right in this moment I worry most that this sister [[Tchyen]] may inform the [[Blind Sisters]] of the events. What have you told her?"

*She paused, allowing him to answer.*

"I requested she keep her dream between us, and told her nothing of my fears about [[Ngtsu]]. She is a devout sister but she is also deeply trusting of me, she will not spread any word of this I assure you."
"That is good, then we should tell you what we have been doing..."

*She stands and the other figures follow suit, fanning out to stand in front of small person sized cloisters lining the walls. They removed their hoods, revealing their old faces shining with a sense of pride. Kuex steps around so that she is standing directly across from Neung, with the center point of the room between their feet. As she does, the [[Ghuners]] step back into their cloisters and the stones below their feet shift down slightly. The sounds of ropes and chains whipping through the air lights up the cave and is then harmonized with by gears creaking and clicking. Stones moved mechanically in the walls, opening more fissures of light, all equidistant around the round room and at differing heights. New rays of light pierce through these openings, glancing off the crystalline veins along the room's edges and casting bright lights to the floor. Neung's mouth falls slack as he sees the light bounce off what he thought were random trinkets and instruments. Beautiful rainbows of colour shoot from the semi-opaque ones and various clear circles cause the rays to pinch or widen. His eyes trace the light until he sees all the light eventually becomes concentrated by the clear circles and convocates on the point at his feet. Kuex leans down and palms a small vial of powder from within her sleeve. She uncorks it and lets the powder contained within pour out onto the ground. It alights quickly, which alone causes Neung to take a step back. He is further amazed as the flame begins to flicker between a green and pink, before settling into a brilliant gold flame. He immediately looked up to Kuex, seeing the stunning flame reflected in the dark pupils of her eyes.*

"What is the meaning of this? What magic occurs here? How have you conjured such work of [[Ngok]]!" 

*Kuex snapped out of the trancelike state, breaking line of sight with the flame.*

"Worry not Neung. This is not magic at all. Your aptitude has not let you down however, the flame is of course the domain of Ngok. And yet we have tamed it. But remember now, how could this be wrong for us to do. Our people have already tamed the flame for centuries. Our order here has done great work to understand the properties of materials spawned from [[Puhl]]. These powders are ground from shining stones which originate in these very caves. We have simply created a new breed of flame, in the same way the early tribes created new breeds of camel, which of course was the domain of Ngok and Ngtsu-"

*The name sent a chill down Neung's back, and he shook his head, interrupting the Ghuner.*

"I cannot believe it. You'd all always spoken of great discoveries and advancements, but I could never have expected something so amazing. This is astoundingly beautiful. I am somewhat wary of this new science, but in the same breath I must admit I am extremely intrigued."

*Neung sat down on the cold stone. His face twisted in deep contemplation. Kuex walks over and begins to speak.*

"Do you recall in section 3 of the first chapter of the [[Klim Chak]], when Haghba speaks of peering and explains how we must all have the abilities of [[Klah]], to speak things into existence, for we are his inheritors and children, as well as the truest children of Ngok? Klah's first spawn were Ngtsu and Puhl, they both have some of the powers of Klah, but were constrained by the limits imposed at their creation. We would be so limited to, if we were simply spawned from Puhl. But as Ngok's tears were of raw and true emotion, there was no inhibition or consideration placed into these emotions, and so our creation was one of unlimited potential. Our intelligence, our awareness, our ability to peer and commune with these gods, is the result of this. Haghba new all of this, and studied it deeply. He tried to tell the people, but they did not listen to him. Instead we have worked deeply to truly understand..."

*She reaches into her cloak, revealing a thick tome filled with pages of differing sizes and bound with string and a simple animal skin dyed white. Instantly, everything clicks in Neung's mind.*

"The [[Chak Awr]]! You have obtained the lost book? This is impossible. It was simply a folk tale, a rumor. Haghba had not truly written a second volume in his last years, there was nothing discovered at along with his belongings!"

*Neung couldn't help but spout the narrative he'd come to accept, but he knew he'd always had doubts. He was also immensely curious, still not forgetting the great display the [[Ghuners]] had just put on for him. He began to think about the implications of the discovery of the manuscripts when Kuex interrupted his thoughts.*

"There was nothing **reported** as discovered, other than the artefacts we all know. However, the original member of our order was among those who discovered that the prophet had disappeared. Yes, these are the true manuscripts. We have deeply studied them, as much as we can. You see, these texts are... not exactly... comprehensible. It is too much to explain right now but we believe that only one person could ever decipher them. That person is you Neung. You are the true successor of Haghba."

*Remembering what [[Hugn]] had said earlier, Neung turned to his old friends face, who simply returned the glance with a slight smile curling in the right edge of his lips. Turning back to the woman in front of him, Neung sighs.*

"I am really not sure what to make of all this. It is so much to take in, I must ruminate on this I believe. I am starting to think I understand what is really going on with all these events, all so close together. Please my friends, you must trust me."

*He steps towards Kuex, extending his arm with his palm upturned and open.*

"Please, I need to study the Chak Awr..."

/

*Several moments passed, the air tense, Neung could feel his heart beating in his chest, feeling like it was about to burst through. It felt as though seconds slowed to hours, his arm grew heavy and shaky. Kuex' face hardened, the softened. She stepped forwards and places the tome into the outstretched palm, cupping his hand from below. Her eyes meet his and he studies them, noticing glints deep in the pupils. At first he thinks they are reflections but then he they actually emanate light from within. He blinks, and his tunnel vision resides. He thanks the surrounding figures, who now have approached from out of their cloisters. He turns towards the entrance, breathes deeply, and begins the journey back to the city of [[Name]], leaving behind the cave from whence the Ravhavan people were born.*

*As Neung began walking into the tunnel, the cold overtook him again. He waded out into the inky blackness. Crouching down once again, he felt the tunnel constrict all around his body. He continued further through, unable to estimate how much longer he would have to walk and tilting his head realizing that he could no longer see either end of the tunnel. Thankfully, he soon began to feel the corridor expand, allowing him to stand again. He continued to walk for quite some time. Surely the journey in had not taken this long he thought, but brushed it off and persevered on. Some time later he seriously began to doubt his time telling, assuredly he should be at the temple by now? As the doubt seeped into his mind, poisoning his thoughts, something else creeped into his psyche. He realized he could no longer feel any stone beneath his feet, he was now cycling his legs as if treading water in the black nothingness, but for the life of him could not remember when the sure rock gave way to void. His mind swam with thoughts, before they were interrupted by a quiet trickle. He winced, his ears opening wider than they had ever before. The trickle slowly became a stream, and then a rushing force. He began to panic, trying to turn his body around and escape the oncoming torrent but suddenly felt the nothingness grip onto his legs and pull up across his torso and arms, locking him in place. The rush became louder, filling his ears until it was unbearable. Neung realized his eyes were pressed stiffly shut, and he tensed his entire body in anticipation of the wave slamming into him. Instead, a whisper flowed into his ear.*

"I so dearly apologize that we were interrupted my dear. We have very important matters to discuss, though I'm sure you have figured that out by now..."

*The voice trailed off, hissing like the last few grains of sand in an hourglass. Neung felt his stomach rise in his throat, the intense fear gripping him again. He steeled his nerves slightly and decided he could not play the coward any longer. He spoke, uttering just the name of the being with which he now spoke.*

"Ngtsu."
