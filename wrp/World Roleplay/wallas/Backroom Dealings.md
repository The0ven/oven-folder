[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*[[Tchankh]] was staring out over the river flowing through [[Burlingam]]. His workers were finishing construction on a port and new swing bridge designed by members of the [[Neung-Alchem]]. The city was a vital node in Awalentse, controlling the flow of materials from the southern river into the protectorate. He was invited here by the region's magistrate for a progress update on the construction but he was really here to meet with a contact. He'd heard that someone here had information on [[Vedius Dalmaticus]]. He knew he would be meeting him soon and he knew he needed more than just persuasive language to convince him to do what he wanted.*

"Jackal? Is that you Jackal? I have some information for you."

*Tchankh spun on his heel, surprised he had not heard the speaker's footsteps. At first he saw nothing, then he felt a light tug on the loose fabric flowing down past his knee. He looked down and saw a small face staring up at him, bright eyes and fair skin only slightly dirtied by dust from the sandstorms common the region. Tchankh knelt and brushed the dust from his cheeks, speaking back:*

"Who are you child? Who is this **Jackal** you refer to?"

*The boy shook his head, pointing to Tchankh and producing a small wooden carving, the face of a desert jackal etched into the surface. Tchankh smiled and took the carving, then prompted the child further:*

"Ah I see, alright then. Can you answer me this? When was the last time an Ibni warrior was bested in hand to hand combat?"

*The boy opened his lips as if to speak, but then hesitated a moment, considering his response. Eventually he nodded, confirming he'd arrived at the answer and responded.*

"Well, never of course!"

*Tchankh was practically beaming, he chuckled quietly and nodded.*

"Very good, thank you. Now what is the information you have for me?"

*The boy shook his head again, and pointed a Baobab tree sticking from the river bank, with a man leaning against it. Tchankh nodded and stood, dropping a few coins from his pouch into the child's hands. The boy smiled and ran off to a group of other children gathered nearby who all gasped at the sight of the shiny coins. Tchankh walked over to the man the boy hand indicated, and as he approached he realized that the figure's head was shrouded by a large woven hat placed over his face. He reached him and rapped his knuckles lightly against the hat.*

"Hello? Anyone home? The Jackal is interested."

*A palm extended, upturned, and the other hand was a fist clutching a roll of parchment. Tchankh went to grab the paper but felt the man resist. Sighing, he placed a further sum of coins into the open palm, which retracted and dropped each coin one by one into a pouch, the man nodding with each clink. Once sufficient clinks had been heard, the man slightly unfurled his fist, prompting Tchankh to take the scroll. He pocketed it in his robes and walked about fifty paces to a shrouded market stall, where he hunched over to protect the contents from prying eyes and unfurled it. As he did, he saw it was a ledger titled **"Official Copy"**, numbers and names noted down. It all seemed regular to Tchankh, until he saw writing below the ledger, **"Collector's Copy"** and then the beginnings of another table, this time with the numbers slightly lower than the ones above. However, as he continued reading he found only a few rows of the official ledger, with the remainder being ripped from the bottom. Although this was evidence, there was no signature on it or markings proving it was related to Vedius. Disgruntled, he turned to scold the man, but he had disappeared from under the tree. In his place, a small wooden block sat at the base of the tree. Tchankh picked it up and saw the same carving of the jackal, along with an inscription:*

**TRUTH ARRIVES SO COLD
FROM THE SEA WHERE STRONG MEN FLED
TO ALWAYS POINT NORTH**

*Sitting atop a camel, Tchankh rolled the carving over in his hand. He was travelling north, unsure to exactly where. The poem had evidently been a clue to his final destination, where he would find the second piece of the scroll, but he could not quite decipher it. Obviously it was one of the northern coastal cities of Awalentse, but there were many. The second half of the central line confounded him. Who were the strong men? When and why did they flee? And of course, where did they flee from? He wracked his brain for all the history of the land he could recall, delving deep into books he'd read in Valentan after [[Emira]] had asked him to take over the regency. As Consul, he'd continued his studies but no matter how deep he delved he was drawing blank after blank. He was jolted back to reality when his camel slowed, the caravan around him stopping to make camp for the night. He disembarked his furry companion and tied it's lead to a branch. They had arrived at a trading post midway between [[Jersan]] and [[Jezun]], having taken the more direct route via desert rather than a carriage, which would have required he travel through Jersan, where Vedius had eyes everywhere. He could not afford to give up the slight lead he had on the magistrate. He settled down with some food, grilled cactus flesh wrapped in a flatbread. The meal was familiar, he'd grown up in [[Baoh]], only an short trek from the Awalentse border after all, but the name was new. Here they called it "Velinam", but he'd always know it to be "[[Ghav]]". He loaded his bread with the additional fermented cactus, trying to overpower the salt from the grilled filling. As he ate he watched the other caravaners, mostly [[Elh]] but some Awalentse among them. One of the Awalentse was telling a story around the camp fire, of the end of the [[Valente War]].*

"At the height of the war, the mad king DeRosa was deposed by his generals, overthrown in a coup. The generals disagreed on how to proceed, and lacking the force to hold of Ravhava and the [[Csarian Empire]], they in turn fell. One general however, lead his force away from the surrendering troops. He retreated north with his legion, the 127th and they left for greener pastures, abandoning Valente in order to never serve a foreign power. They stole ships from the port of **Venian** and have not been heard from since..."

*As the man continued, the Tchankh was distracted by a figure moving in the distance. At first he thought it was a human on all fours, but then he saw the glowing eyes glance back, and could make out the silhouette of a **Jackal**...*

*Sand was everywhere, the wind whipping at him relentlessly. Tchankh was a few hours past [[Restoria]], almost arriving at [[Venian]], but a sandstorm had kicked up. He'd long departed from the desert caravan, who'd turned north for Jezun after the night camped out. On his own, he shielded his eyes against the abrasive sand and tried to ignore as it grated against his bare calves. Gritting his teeth, he pushed north still, his camel slowed by the torrential winds. He carried on like this for hours, slowing to a crawl at points as the buffets of wind continued. Finally, the sand calmed, wind now the only thing holding him back. The air was salty, sea breeze wafting through his nostrils. Eventually, the ceaseless wind did cease, calming to a whimpering breeze. He crested a dune and saw ahead a sight for sore eyes. He'd reached Venian.*

*As Tchankh entered the port town, he found the guild hall of the local division of the Elh camel trade where he could return his camel with a notarized scroll and receive the money he'd put down back in Burlingam minus a fee for each day he'd held onto it. Money in pocket, he began to wander around town, looking for anything that could be a sign for him. As he strolled, he reached the harbour and decided to continue his search later, opting to walk along the water for a while. As he walked, he passed the harbourmaster's cabin, who looked down, watching him. An older Awalentse man emerged from the doorway, descending a staircase rough hewn from the stone cliffs the harbour was carved out of. He outstretched a hand:*

"Hello friend, welcome to Venian. We seldom get many visitors this far north, so excuse the lack of hospitality. My name is [[Mamilius Silvius]], I am the harbour master and count of the town. You of course must be Tchankh."

*Tchankh was taken aback, the man's demeanor was kind and jovial, but hearing his own name from the mouth of a stranger was surprising.*

"Oh I apologize if I have shocked you, but everyone throughout Awalentse knows your name, and anyone important your face. I remember seeing you at the [[Tusc Accord]], although I was granted this small parcel of land as something of a footnote to the more major land swaps so I forgive you if you do not recall me."

*Tchankh had to admit, the face was somewhat familiar, although he could not quite place it. Instead, he responded.*

"Thank you for your kindness Mamilius, and I assure you, lack of hospitality is something I appreciate. Many counts would, unlike yourself, fall head over heels to welcome me, hoping for some special privilege or something. Can you imagine how disappointed they all were when I refused their lavish gifts and ceremonies?! Ha!"

*Both men chuckled, and Tchankh smiled, looking around at the harbour as men began to pack up and leave for the evening. The sun was starting to set over the sea, and his mission returned to his mind. He thought for a second, and then reconsidered.*

"I am in town on business unfortunately, but perhaps do you have a place for one such as myself to rest my head? Nothing special, a simple inn will suffice."

"Well that is very good, since a simple inn is all we have, just at the other edge of the harbour, if you continue walking you wont miss it. I had better be off now, must check in with all the ship foreman before nightfall and all. I bid you adieu, hopefully you will be able to return another time for more pleasant matters..."

*The man bowed, swiveled, and walked off towards the ships. Tchankh grinned, knowing he would be more than happy to return to the quaint town and the jovial count. He turned and continued walking along the boardwalk, looking out and admiring the beautiful oranges and yellows of the sunset stretching out across the shimmering blue ocean. Finally, he reached the stairs back up to the town, and climbed them to see the small central quarter of the town. At the centre of the square was a statue of the harbour, filled with large warships chiseled from stone. Past it was a tavern, noise and light streaming from the open windows. As he approached, he saw a sign:*

**The Jackal Tavern and Inn**

*Tchankh allowed his body to sink back into the bed, comfortable as he could be, and pulled his pillow in towards his head. He'd purchased the room for the night from a rotund woman behind the bar to who he'd had to shout to be heard over the noise of drunken revelry. He'd been shown up to his room by her daughter, a young woman who'd complimented his Valentan and was now busy fetching supper for him. He thought he could get a quick rest in before she returned, but he heard her knuckles rap against the door frame and he sat up to see her standing in the open doorway holding a tray, waiting for permission to enter.*

"Oh well come in then, the door is open, what would waiting for my permit grant you?"

*The woman quickly shuffled in and placed the plates and bowl on the table beside his bed, bowing and closing the door on her way out. Tchankh turned to his food, bone broth with more flatbread, and dipped the bread into the soup before taking a bite. It was surprisingly hearty, much more soothing than the strong cactus he'd had in the desert. As he finished the bread, he picked up the bowl to drink the last of his broth. Out of the corner of his eye he spotted a small etching in the tray, hidden by the bowl at first. It was, of course, another jackal. This time, the message below was clear.*

"OPEN THE WINDOW"

*Abiding by the message, he unlocked the small latch on the window above his headboard and pulled the glass in, its hinge at the top creaking slightly, rusted from the humid sea air. That same sea air filled his nostrils again as he did, and even better, he saw a small cylinder wrapped in heavy parchment stored on the edge of the window. Bringing it in and unwrapping it, he rolled out the second half of the scroll. Taking the first piece from his robes, he placed them together on the bed, putting together the full picture for the first time. He scanned quickly, seeing that the official copy was indeed listing values all slightly less than the collector's copy. The dates and names were all identical, someone had been skimming off the top of the taxes. Excitedly, he looked to the bottom of the page, expecting to see Vedius' signature there as chief magistrate, but instead his jaw dropped. He was crestfallen, the final, most important piece, tying the whole document to Vedius, was missing. It too had been ripped from the page, this time much more deliberately, only the small corner where the signature should lay was torn. Defeated, Tchankh stored the two fragments in his robes, dropped his head down onto the pillow, and surrendered to sleep.*

*The air was tense as Tchankh rode into Jersan. This time, he travelled from Venian by carriage through [[Glaxia]] and then south at Jezun. Now, the gates of the Awalentse capital stood imposingly in front of him. The portcullis raised, allowing his carriage entry, and he drummed his fingers on the wooden seat at it trundled into the city, bumping on each cobblestone of the road. As the carriage moved through the winding roads, flanked by tall houses, it reached the guild hall and stopped momentarily. The door swung open, and [[Tsawb]] of the [[Grain & Livestock Guild]] stepped in. He sat beside Tchankh, who refused to meet his eye and rather stared at the front wall of the carriage. Tsawb leaned in as the carriage pulled away, and whispered:*

"My sources inform me that you are meeting with Vedius, and that you have something to hold over his head. Well, I think we could both benefit from this. I need some contracts handed over to me in full, through a group of mine that operates on behalf of the guild across Awalentse. You have a child at home, do you not? I believe I have a beautiful villa in [[Hotepoh]] that is lying vacant, perhaps she would like a change of scenery?"

*Tchankh clenched his jaw, still looking straight on.*

"I'm afraid your sources are wrong, I've got nothing of the sort for the magistrate, simply here for a regularly scheduled check in. He's got some reports for me, that is all."

*The carriage was nearing the magisterial offices now, a wide semicircle with two wins spanning out towards the front like presenting an embrace. Yet there was nothing warm about them. People milled about the center, moving from one office to the other with various scrolls and documents signed and sealed by various people of various import. Before they reached the entrance, Tsawb sighed and hopped out of the carriage, offering one final thing:*

"Well, if anything does come up. Do not forget the Grain & Livestock Guild."

*With that, he winked and shut the carriage door, and moments later it pulled up to the center of the arcing building. A set of grandiose pillars flanked the deep brown baobab wood. Descending from the carriage and pushing through the doors, Tchankh was greeted by two guards.*

"Consul Tchankh, the grand magistrate will now see you in his chambers. Please, follow us."

*He obliged, and climbed a staircase wrapping the interior back edge of the magisterial offices, passing the second and third floors to reach a small fourth floor, where a domed office sat. There, staring out the windows, was Vedius. Tchankh held in a sneer as he saw the man, knowing how close he'd been to gathering the evidence to secure him under the Ravhavan thumb. Tchankh sat at the only seat pulled out from the long table as Vedius turned and walked over to his seat opposite Tchankh, at the head of the table. As he pulled out his almost thronelike seat, he greeted Tchankh:*

"Thank you for making the journey all the way here my friend, I trust your journey was not too haggard? I know our deserts can be unforgiving at times..."

"Thank you Vedius, and no, it was actually pleasant. I managed to visit the seaside on my way up from Burlingam."

*Of course, he did not specify that the seaside he'd visited had been the one past Jersan. Tchankh had been thinking about his next move since he'd awoken in Venian, and he was still unsure exactly what the future held for him. He trusted his instinct however, and simply allowed the magistrate to take the reins of the conversation.*

"I of course have all the documentation needed for this year's visit, at the top of course are this year's tax collections, sectioned by province. I hope everything is to your liking..."

*Vedius motioned to one of his servants, who lifted a large pile of parchment from the shelf and placed it on the table before Tchankh with a heavy thud. He looked down at the pile and felt his stomach drop as he saw a ledger identical to the "Official" copy contained in his robes. He held in his rage and looked back to Vedius.*

"That is all well, I will review them upon my return. I am sure everything is more than fine. Rather, I have an urgent matter we must discuss. Privately."

*He said the last word through clenched teeth, and Vedius hesitated for a moment before dismissing his guards and servants, then returned his attention to Tchankh waiting impatiently for him to continue. Instead, Tchankh stood and approached his seat.*

"What is the meaning of this! Who do you think you are?!"

*Tchankh stopped, looming over the grand magistrate, so close Vedius could feel Tchankh's breath on his cheek.*

"Do not think for a second you have gotten away with it. I know it is you who has been stealing, just because you try to destroy evidence does not mean I will not find it."

"W-w-whatever could you mean? I have not stolen a penny..."

*Tchankh had given up on gaining the upper hand, resolving instead to show his cards and frighten the magistrate best he could. He reached into his robes and pulled out the three sections of parchment, slamming them on the table. Wait... three? Tchankh looked down, sure enough there were three pieces, the two scrolls he'd recovered in Burlingam and Venian and a third, tiny slip of parchment. He read the signature on it over and over in his head, and then said it aloud.*

"Grand Magistrate Vedius Dalmaticus, I am charging you with stealing funds from the state, lying to a state official, and abusing the powers of magistrate. That is, unless we can come to some sort of agreement."

*Vedian's eyes were wide, flicking back and forth between Tchankh and the signature.*

"B-b-but h-how I- I don't... How did you find this? I don't understand..."

*Like a mouse caught in a trap, Vedian was struggling best he could against the vice grip Tchankh was imposing but luckily he could not struggle well.*

"That does not matter, you are clearly guilty. You have yet to deny anything. Now, I would like to discuss the matters of contracts for construction. Your offices will contribute the entire share on the upcoming constructions in [[Ngatu]], [[Portzeen]], and [[Tsecho]] but the half and half split of control will remain. You will also grant the Grain and Livestock Guild rights to operate without restriction across Awalentse. You will help fund the construction of Yucka churches around the country. Finally, you will grant the country of Venian full payment for future infrastructure contracts. Oh, and of course, stop stealing from us. This offer is even quite generous, considering what would happen should these ledgers come to light..."

*Tchankh was outside again, walking swiftly to his carriage. The day had been won, even if it was against all odds and even logic. How had that final piece appeared in his pocket. As he stepped into his carriage he saw a golden placed by his seat. On it was an engraved jackal's face. He picked it up and felt another pattern on the back. Turning it over, he saw what he'd feared may be true. A G&LG was engraved into the other side...*
