*A laugh pierced the void's silence. A horrid laugh like crackling and crunching brush being trampled by hooves. [[Neung]] felt his stomach churn but clenched his jaw and breathed deeply, steeling himself against the grating noise. [[Ngtsu]] continued to laugh, then slowed to a chuckle which petered out slowly. Then she began to speak.*

"Well, it seems you have some fight in you after all. I was starting to get worried my friend was wrong about you. But worry not Neung, I wish you no harm. In fact, I wish the opposite, I wish to collaborate with you and I believe together we can upend the entire order of things as they are. I've been watching you for some time now Neung and I know how you think. I'm sure you have many many questions for me, so feel free to speak your mind and ask anything you wish."

*Neung swallowed. His mouth felt try and his head was spinning. What could this nigh all-powerful god want with him? How could he of all people be so important that all these events were happening at once with him at the center. Many high priests had come and gone with little intrigue or drama so why could his life not just be predictable and boring. He shook his head, forcing him to clear his mind. The truth was he was in this situation and needed to figure out his next steps. Critically, whether or not he could trust this god which he'd exalted in prayer for much of his life.*

"Alright, I'll hear you out. What could I possibly help you with thought? You are a god! A direct emanation of [[Klah]]!"

*Neung thinks back about what [[Kuex]] had told him, that humans had been born without limits. Perhaps there truly was something the gods could not do that they needed humanity for... Before he could continue his train of thought Ngtsu cut him off:*

"Yes, however, you are special. All you mortals are special, born of [[Ngok]] and [[Puhl]]. You all have a divine spark, just as we gods do. You especially Neung, you may have believed that because you were unable to peer for so long that you maybe lack some of this divine essence, that something was wrong. But this is not the case my dear, you are in fact very special. You see, your mind was never polluted by the realm of dreams, this plane in which we now commune. Your life was lived completely outside the influence of any secondary narratives going on in your sleep. While others make use of their time in slumber fantasizing, fashioning the world in their own image just as the gods did outside of the dream, you spent it contemplating and learning things; things that were very much real. You psyche therefore is like a fortress, impenetrable to influence by other peerers and even us gods. My proposal is this: You help me through your position as high priest by influencing your flock. Preach my words in your sermons and people will listen. As my influence grows I will then be able to convince my progenitor to remove the limits placed on me at my inception. Please Neung, you cannot possibly understand how unbearable it is to be so restricted and constrained. You have heard my voice, do you think people feel comfortable and welcomed when they hear it? NO!"

/

*Ngtsu's voice had been gradually climbing in volume as she explained her plan, now a scream. She was not wrong, her voice was torturous and her domain perhaps the most limiting of all the gods. For a moment, Neung felt a pang of sorrow for the tortured soul trapped in sand. Perhaps this was not a bad idea; after all, she was simply asking him to help her convince the other gods to help her. All these thoughts burned through his mind a mile a minute. He felt as though timed slowed to allow him to think while she spoke. He noticed his body had softened, relaxed, his eyes still firmly shut, yet he could see perfectly fine the black ooze expanding and contracting around him. He could also "see" a presence in front of him, although he couldn't make out what the figure exactly looked like. It seemed out of focus constantly and whenever he tried to look straight at it he could feel pain emanating from the back of his eyeballs. He tried to move his body but found he still couldn't although the ooze had visibly retracted somewhat from his limbs, now sitting around his knees and elbows. He was of course wary of Ngtsu's proposal, but also had been moved by her speech. As he continued to think he realized she'd stopped talking completely and he heard a sound he had never expected from the god. A quiet weeping sound filled his ears, tender and soft unlike the usual abrasive chord the god usually had. He spoke to her:*

"I hear your plight oh great one, your story has truly moved me. I am worried though, will I not be working against the interests of the other Gods. And to add to that, have you not been working against them through communing with me? I may not have peered before the previous night but I am thoroughly read on your laws and understand you are all bared from communing with us humans. Perhaps if I could visit the other Gods I would feel more safe in this plan. For now I worry greatly about the implications of empowering that which the great Kl--"

*His voice cut off as he spoke, his mouth suddenly unable to close and dry as desert. He attempted to breathe and felt his lungs burn as they filled. Fear filled his mind and he began to thrash about as much as the ooze would allow. The figure in front of him had disappeared, but he sensed a presence still, as if it was occupying the same space as he was. Suddenly, Ngtsu's voice returned the soft tone replaced by the grating hissing again. The words made Neung's skin crawl as they echoed deep into his skull, as if spoken from inside his brain.*

"DO NOT exalt his name. My progenitor is no greater than me. We gods do not work on the same level as you petty mortals and Klah is LESS, not more, than the sum of his parts. Puhl and I together are greater than he EVER COULD BE! You mortals are all the same, set in your beliefs and beholden to your gods! I thought you would be different Neung, your mind uncorrupted and free from the dream's influence, but you are no different to the others. You had a chance to be something greater but now you have condemned yourself to be a pawn FOREVER!"

/

*Neung's eyes squeezed ever further shut as he thrashed around in the void. Sand coated everything from his lungs to his lips and his thrashing slowed as he realized the reality of his situation. He was going to die here, he knew his death here would leave his physical body outside of the dream without a mind. He wondered how much time had passed in the physical world. The god had picked a good time to take him, the [[Ghuners]] would not expect him back for some time and he had been known to spend days in the chambers past the doors at the back of the temple. He wistfully thought back to the town of [[Name]], to his chambers. He had been so caught up in his dream and what [[Tchyen]] had said he had left in such a hurry and he realized, without bidding his pet cat [[Lua]] goodbye for the day. He smiled to himself, humored that he really was such a loner he thought of his cat first when faced with death. He allowed himself to relax slightly, reveling in his memory as he felt time slow to a crawl within his brain. He figured he had lived a decent life, at the very least a pious and noble life. He thought back on opportunities past, searched for regrets; a partner who's love he'd lost or an opportunity to live a more prosperous life. But when he reflected he saw naught, simply memories of happy nights spent alone with Lua in his study, or with the sisters throughout his childhood. While his life had been somewhat mundane day to day, he was ultimately grateful for that. In this moment of calm he found a feeling he'd long grasped after, a feeling so absolute it was unquantifiable. He felt perfectly content. Then something clicked.*

*That was it! He quickly began to think back over the last day, the most intense day of his life, remembering each detail as well he could. He rewound to the moment in the [[Cave of Ghun]] when [[Kuex]] had captured his attention. What was it she'd said again?*

*"We would be so limited to, if we were simply spawned from Puhl. But as Ngok's tears were of raw and true emotion, there was no inhibition or consideration placed into these emotions, and so our creation was one of unlimited potential."*

*Neung's mind felt itself flip open and unfold like a book, his thoughts a pen scratching new information into its rough parchment. He realized now what this meant. Unlimited potential meant he was not fully at the mercy of Ngtsu right now, he just had to figure out how to fight it. He thought back further, the answer must be somewhere in his memory he could feel it. Then he remembered the first thing of that day, his rude awakening. Sister [[Tchyen]] had said she'd seen him thrashing in pain the last time he'd been in the realm of dreaming. He focused hard on the member of [[Blind Sisters]] who he'd spent the past ten years with. She'd always been such a kind presence in his life, caring for him while he was lost in vast tomes and ancient scripture. She was also brilliant, offering insight where he needed it an always keeping him grounded.*

/

*Suddenly he saw her, a speck of light in the distance, his mind shot over to her, leaving his body as he realized he was in full control of himself for the first time. His mind had taken over and allowed him to project out of his body. There he saw her, sister Tchyen, fighting against a blasting sandstorm like an [[Elh]] caravanner. She was reading from a small tome in her hands, speaking words in a language he could not make out. She would read a passage and then lift a small steel ball from her hand stamped with an image of a mountain, a symbol of Puhl. As she did, the storm would let up slightly and she could advance. As if sensing his presence, she looked up and met his eyes. She looked more serious than he had ever seen, her small figure steeled in the wind. She closed the book and pointed to it, showing the cover to him. He was confused for a moment and she was slightly rebuffed by the wind as her efforts ceased, but then he realized. The book she was reading from was his copy of the [[Rilgish Malgar]], a non-Ravhavan text he'd collected while travelling east of the [[Dragon's Spine Mountains]]. Suddenly his eyes widened, he'd never shown her the book, only told her of it and yet there was an identical copy in her hands. How could she have manifested it in such perfect detail without ever reading it. The final piece of the puzzle clicked into place and he suddenly understood.*

*He found his spirit back in his body and without a moment he gripped with his right hand down and his finger and thumb brush tightly against rough hide. The ooze exploded from his right hand and his eyes shot fully open. He pulled his arm in and saw in front of him the [[Chak Awr]] in the same hand he'd been holding it when he'd fallen into dream.*

*He looked up and saw her, or rather it. The entity he'd sensed before but had been unable to make out with his dream vision. Ngtsu stood before him in all the glory and horror deserving of a god. The shape vaguely resembled an armless bust, the god's chest and head prominently protruding towards him while the space the rest of a body would be was sand flowing extremely fast into a sphere surrounding the two. The bust itself was not truly one thing as it shifted quickly; sand, water, blood, oil, clouds, back to blood. The shifting was inconsistent across the body, leaving these different fluids swirling together into the bust's form as if contained in a clear vase. Neung felt his the skin on his back crawl but swallowed deeply and returned his vision to the book.*

*The pages flew open, his left hand now also dislodged and blurring through as if guided by an unknown force, until he reached a semi blank page. He began to read:*

```

Section 0:

"...contained in a clear vase. Neung felt his the skin on his back crawl but swallowed deeply and returned his vision to the book.

The pages flew open, his left hand now also dislodged and blurring through as if guided by an unknown force, until he reached a semi blank page. He began to read:"

```

*Neung was so stunned he couldn't find words, yet he began to speak. Commanding words out into the ether speaking of events to come. They appeared on the page suddenly:*

```
Chak Awr Chapter 2: What Comes After - By 44231534511533
Section 0:
"...events to come. They appeared on the page suddenly: "Wild god Ngtsu hear me and heel. Release me from your binding and return from whence you came. My soul is strong and my skin burns your touch. Realase me!" as these words were spoken the great fluid torso shook and visible ripples appeared. The substances changed more frequently and the body recoiled in pain into the whirling winds around."
```

*And the truths he spoke into the book came to be, the torso dissipated in front of his eyes and he felt himself awake. His face was pressed against the stone floor, cold from the damp air of the cave. His throat and lungs felt dry as bone but as he stood up, peeling his face and bare chest from the rock he noticed his body seemed to course with a refreshed vigor. In his hand he still clutched the Chak Awr. Hesitantly, he flipped it open but discovered only the first chapter, What Came Before, was legible. Even then it was a confusing mess, text scrawled in all different directions, sometimes random symbols in patters mimicking those he'd seen back in the [[Cave of Ghun]]. He flipped to the pages he'd read from while peering but couldn't understand what he saw. There was ink on the page for certain, but it formed no words, instead it seemed to flow around on the page uncontrollably, shifting as if controlled by some external force. Sighing, he closed the book and continued making his way back to the doors at the entrance to the tunnel and found himself once again in the dimly lit alcove.*

*He lifted the heavy brace off the door and opened it, stepping out into the temple once again. Little had changed since he'd arrived, but the sun now lay low on the horizon and many of the crowds had dispersed back into [[Name]] to return home for the night. One figure he did make note of was a stout woman running up the stairs of the temple towards him. Her hair was tied up in a high bun and her black cloak flowed down to her ankles. He smiled, Tchyen saw him and slowed, huffing and puffing after seemingly running all the way up to the temple from the village below. She embraced him, wrapping her arms around his torso, forcing him to lift his up in surprise before allowing them to rest on her shoulders. After she finally released him he realized she was crying.*

"I thought I was going to have to watch you die Neung. You cannot put yourself in danger like that again. To put yourself up against a god?? Are you insane??"

*She angrily whispered to him through the tears, her voice caught in her throat. His face dropped as he realized how she must feel.*

"I am so sorry. I never really had a chance to tell you anything, or a choice to get involved in this. Everything is alright now though, you need not worry. Come, let us return to the homestead. I'm certain Lua has been awaiting our return."

*Tchyen smiled and they both turned and walked towards the temple exit. Together the stood out overlooking the town from where the Ravhavans originated. And Neung felt that same contentment he'd felt in what he thought were his final moments. Neung was happy.*
