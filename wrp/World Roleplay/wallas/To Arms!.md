[[_Ravhavan Union]]

*The [[Ibni]] have long been the protectors of Ravhava, and in their current capacity serve a vital role as the armed forces for both defensive and offensive actions. However, as the size of Ravhava grows, the need for a larger and larger army so grows. [[Emira]] weighs her options and eventually decides that a plan to expand the army will take place in two stages: First, the mandate allowing other tribes to volunteer for the garrison force to defend will be made permanent, and salaries for the garrison forces will be upgraded to that of a first year solider. The second phase will come later, and expand the armed forces greatly, improving the Union's infantry capabilities with the Ibni remaining to serve as trainer, officers, and elite cavalry. The Ibni will lead the new Ravhavan army into a golden era of strength, bringing back lessons from the war with the Valtir to teach our people about sieges and modern tactics and equipment. The entire structure of the army will also be rewritten, with individual ranks being assigned based on experience and merit as well as an official officer corps being standardized and routes to promotion outlined. Subdivisions of army groups will also be standardized to better organize our forces.*
