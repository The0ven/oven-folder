[[Bottanic's Recompense - 4 - Bottanic]]

## A Cruel Mistress
*Flames licked upwards from the western banks of the Bottanic River. The [[Bottanic Kingdom]] forces stood triumphantly, watching as the camps of the [[Nanacatl]] burned in bright pyres before them. They breathed a sigh of relief, the northern heartlands were again free from the shroomers.*

*The next morning, the invasion of the peninsula begins. Once Bottanic land, the Nanacatl have maintained control of it since the beginning of the war. The jungle has always been used to the great advantage of the defenders and now is no different, the defenders are just the Nanacatl now. Fortified in their towers, and with camps built up over the occupation, the Nanacatl hold strong against all attempts to even cross the river, as during their retreat the Nanacatl had sunk, burned, or brought in all their pontoon bridges. The few groups that do manage to get across are slaughtered on the shore. Defeated, the Bottanic are forced to retreat and wait alongside the river to ensure no counterattack begins. While the jungle may seem a cruel mistress, she is fair.*
### Casualties:
**Bottanic:** 2,300
**[[Vistadorada]]:** 1,100

## Crossing The Amaris
*Banseth stood on the bank of the Amaris river, eyes steeled as he stared out over the challenge ahead of him. His hands dripped with blood, the last remnant of the Shroomers in the heartlands. He returned to his men, preparing with them for this great challenge.*

*The attack began mere hours later. The raiders charged across the river, using the charred and shattered remnants of the bridges where they could. The Nanacatl watchmen raised alarms, troops began to awake in the black of night and rush towards the beaches. Banseth's head breached the water, and he charged up the riverbed flanked by his men. His blade was hungry and that night it was satisfied more than ever before. The flesh of the shroomers melted around it like butter around a hot knife, their blood fuelling his rage and perseverance. The raiders fought on throughout the night and eventually the forces were made to retreat, falling back to the nearby city of Tlan Lutali. The raiders followed them, but found a mounting resistance force as reinforcements from the region arrived to plug holes. Banseth ordered his men to hold and make camp, the raid had to wait for another day. But the world would remember the day the invaders crossed the Amaris and Banseth knew from this point there was no turning back.*
### Casulaties:
