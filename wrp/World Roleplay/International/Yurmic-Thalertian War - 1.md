[[Yurmic-Thalertian War - 1 - Thalertia]]

# The First Stirrings
*Since the collapse of the [[Thernik Union]], it was only a matter of time before tensions boiled over between the successor states. Now, Komtov stood at the gates of Rhetourteska, preparing to set off towards Thurrenlel. He'd been weary of these orders, unsure if a war was a good idea, especialy with the invaders to the east emerging from [[Simul]]'s collapse and the emergence of the [[Mavaria]]n state to the south. He shook his head as if literally shedding the doubt from his mind and gave the order for the gates to be raised and the army to begin marching.*

*Takav was young compared to his compatriots. He'd risen to the rank of commander quickly following the dissolution of Thernik. He now stood out on the bank of the Xhepaliks, preparing his force to march north into Thalertia. He was excited, he'd had few real opportunities to show his merit in battle, and he knew the Thalertia tactics well and had developed ideas on countering them. He called the flag bearer forth, assembling his well trained force and beginning their offensive north. The force quickly encountered small local garrisons, attacking and capturing the small villages. After a few towns, the forward scouts returned with word that a large army was approaching. Takav rallied his men, high off the easy victories achieved that morning, and prepared to engage the enemy.*

*As his mercenaries fought through Yurmic, Dhananjay could not help but to feel a little pride. Although they were strengthened by the Thalertian allies, his troops were easily showing how their training surpassed that of the Thalertians and Yurmic. The defenders were being forced back in droves, often routed. Dhanjay had heard that the south had not been as successful, and he inwardly smiled feeling as though his force had made the difference. As his force continued however, their luck began to change. The jungle was extremely dense, and reaching Enirslko they quickly realized that the retreating Yurmic forces had sabotaged the roads. With few options on advance, the army was ordered to halt in the city and wait for further instruction. Dhananjay was sour at being told what to do by the high command, but accepted that the payment was worth the subservience, for now...*

*Blood gushed from the open wound just struck across the soldier before Takav. He was leading the charge against the forces of Thalertia sent to face him. His scouts had informed him that the army was sizeable, so he instructed the majority of his men to hide in a jungle and the rest to set up a small camp, hiding in tents with the lights all snuffed as if they were sleeping. The Thalertian troops fell for the trap, and as the engaged the small force they were suprised to find the "sleeping" camp fighting back. Regardless, they were confident in their victory until the Yurmic forces emerged fromt he south west, rushing out of the jungle and forcing the troops towards the river bank. The army split and tried to surround the Yurmic force, but they proved too quick. They fighting was brutal and quickly the Thalertians on the edge of the battle began to route north. Takav was beaming during the victory speech he gave to his men later that night, commending them on their massive defeat even against a force outnumbering them.*
