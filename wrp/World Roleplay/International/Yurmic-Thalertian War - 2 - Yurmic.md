# The Second Erkart Defensive line 
_Amidst the chaos of the initial attack, the soldiers on the Erkart defensive line had no choice but to fall back and regroup. The soldiers hastily retreated to a new location, this time fortified with the assistance of the Mavar Mercenaries. The Mavars, who had garnered a reputation for their expertise in jungle warfare, were a formidable addition to the Erkart army. Over the past few months, the hired mercenaries had been rigorously trained and equipped with specialized gear to combat the unique challenges of fighting in the jungle. However, as the Erkart generals formulated their new defense strategy, they were acutely aware that they could not afford to rely solely on the Mavars. Scouts were dispatched to keep tabs on the movements of the enemy forces, who had now breached the original Erkart line and continued to advance. As the Thalert-Jangar armies drew closer to the new defensive line, the Erkart soldiers were instructed to retreat into the dense cover of the jungle. From there, they could use the terrain to their advantage, launching surprise attacks on the enemy from the flanks and rear. It was a risky plan, but the General Relko the second knew that they had to take bold action. They could not afford to be complacent or to let their enemies dictate the course of the battle. With their backs against the wall, the soldiers on the Ekart Defensive Line steeled themselves for what would surely be a brutal and grueling fight._

# The Tubadske Offensive: 
_After the recent victory, General Takav was eager to continue his momentum and launch a new offensive to capture the strategic city of Ã‰rlaunra. The city was a vital axis point, for it lay relatively close to the mainland of Thaleria, situated across the Xhepaliks river. General Takav intended to use his previous tactics of laying traps and using Thalertian civilians as bait to lure the enemy into his ambushes. General Takav had determined every tactical detail of the upcoming offensive, and his subordinate officers were briefed and fully prepared. However, just a day later, he received word that a sizeable force of 675 Mavar Mercenaries were on their way to aid in the Thalertian defense. These mercs were known for their specialized skills in jungle warfare, making them a dangerous foe to any army. Despite this development, General Takav did not falter and adjusted his strategy accordingly. He reshuffled his forces, positioning the Mavars on the flanks to prepare for a possible enemy ambush, should the Thalertians decide to launch a counteroffensive. Meanwhile, his troops continued to lay traps and fortify their positions, making sure to use the Thalertian civilians in the most effective way possible._

# The Turrenlel Offensive: 
_General Komtov's Lower Thalert Offensive had so far been a success with little resistance from the local Thalertian populace or local forces. However, he knew that the Offensive had to continue, and his next target was the strategically crucial city of Turrenlel. The General planned to take control of the city to establish a connection with the Mavar Border. To achieve his objective, General Komtov gave orders to his soldiers to kill any citizens who gave resistance in the city, with the exception of the Valbs who had settled in the border region under the Commonwealth. This callous command raised concerns amongst some of the soldiers, but they knew the price of disobeying their commanding officer. Amidst the Offensive, General Komtov received a reinforcement of 225 Mavar mercenaries who had recently been hired by the Yurmic army. However, unlike other Generals in Yurmica, he saw the Mavars as a threat to the region's traditional Thernchik ways. In General Komtov's mind, the Mavarians' habits of trading with the populous and spreading their ideas were a potential threat to his vision of a Yurmic-led Thernch. Despite his distrust towards the Mavars, General Komtov could not deny their expertise in jungle warfare. He knew that the Mavar mercs' skills would be invaluable to his men, especially in the dense jungle and unruly terrains surrounding Turrenlel. To make the most of their reinforcements, he ordered the Mavars to be stationed on the flanks and tasked with launching swift, surprise attacks on any Thalertian forces that tried to challenge their advance._
