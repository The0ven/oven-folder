[[Bottanic's Recompense - 3 - Bottanic]]
[[Bottanic's Recompense - 3 - Nancatl]]

## Result:
*The Jungle is swarmed with troops, from both sides, battling for its possession. Together, the large united [[Bottanic Kingdom]] forces advance on the [[Nanacatl]] camps. The Vanachari legion from [[Jangaraja Empire]] prove effective against the smaller camps, but upon reaching the captured fort their ineffectiveness against fortification is evident. The defenders have bunkered down, reinforcing their positions as heavily as possible while the troops have marched on them and are laying in wait when the Bottanic forces appear. Both sides fight mercilessly and ultimately the fact the Nanacatl were not able to capture more forts is their main weakness. The in the center and towards the south the troops are pushed back into the river, fighting valiantly as they are forced to retreat. The single fort maintains its grip though, allowing the Nanacatl to hold in the north. Throughout the battles Nanacatl troops are felled repeatedly as their steel equipment collapses when struck, even easier than bronze or iron would, leading to numerous casualties. The war as a whole is extremely bloody, this week no different in adding to the toll for both nations.*
