***Dhananjay's Bolt:***
*Dhananjay would be carrying out a reassessment of the situation. Currently, he is operating from a village situated on the Kaveritara's shores. The caravan strategy __might__ have been successful, given the circumstances were different, But it did not and so, Dhananjay has to reconfigure the strategy.

*To make substantial gains, He will have to think carefully, Like a military general, Like a strategist, a architect or a player of shatranj (chess).*

*A common strategy followed in the jungle by the Jangarāja to deal with Guerilla & Unconventional warfare, is the division of the main-fighting force into multiple, smaller fighting units. Dhananjay would decide to adopt this decentralized system of tactical organization for this conflict. This would effectively neutralize enemy's guerilla as the concentration of forces in vulnerable positions will be avoided under this organizational strategy.*

***Dhananjay assesses the armaments of his soldiers as he takes a walk among his men. A number of calculations, theories and scenarios play in his mind.***

`"...We need to decrease the amount of armor wore by the warriors. Heavier armor means reduced dexterity and movement, That will not do. I am even going as far as to suggest you men to wear minimal armour."`

***Dhananjay focuses on the newly arrived armaments. He picks up a small shield—a sort of a buckler, That arrived in bulk, on the boats. He showcases it to his soldiers***

`"Look at this, men. This is a shield, and not just any shield. It is made from iron and the skins of animals. Don't underestimate it just because of its size. It has arrived in large numbers from Pushpakaranya, specially for you, my men."`

***Dhananjay takes another shield in hand, a much larger and circular version of the previous one***

`"And this, This will be your most relishing companion."`

***Dhananjay has the buckler in one hand, and the large leather shield in another. He starts by focusing on explaining the buckler first***

`"Now, hear carefully. This is the Dhal, You will use it in close-quarters combat. You should use this small shield with shortswords and even daggers would suffice. It will effectively take the blow of your enemy and give you enough time to counter-attack."`

***Dhananjay then focuses on explaining the larger shield***

`"You will use this one to save your skins from the fury of arrows. It will be your most reliable companion in battle. And I swear to Indra, This will not disappoint you. Use this shield with spears, and you will pierce the skin of your enemies with ease."`

**In a display of his warrior spirit and to showcase effectiveness of the newly arrived armaments in front of his soldiers, Dhananjay starts a duel session with a shortsword and dhal (buckler) in hand. 

**His adversary strikes with his blade, but Dhananjay skillfully parries the soldier's strikes with his buckler and maintains composure. This continues for a few seconds before Dhananjay finds an opening and smashes his opponent's shoulder with his sword, Making his adversary dorp his weapon. Dhananjay successfully immobilized his adversary.**

**Dhananjay addresses his soldiers after his victory in the duel, the young man barely looks tired, though his face is sweaty as hell.**

`"Correct timing and maintenance of posture will pave the way for victory. I personally like my Halberd though, I will just borrow the big shield for saving my skin from those stinky arrows!"`

*`Dhananjay is exploring the tactical & strategic aspects of warfare and trying to find what works the best. Wooden caravans have failed, so let's change the approach. This time around, instead of trying to focus on damage minimization, Let's focus on overwhelming the adversary with superior weaponry & manoeuvre. 

*Dhananjay would organize scouting units who will specifically be tasked with identifying enemy camps and positions. These groups will consist of hardly four men. Intelligence gathering is very crucial and will provide an edge in tactics.*

*Dhananjay's father, the Governor Dharmanandana Vajravarta is the one who is financing the young man's military endeavors. And to support his young boy's successes, The Governor will ensure that his son and soldiers will have adequate weaponry & armaments. Thus, the arrival of the dhal and leather shields.*

*Dhananjay would oversee all these developments himself and try to gain all the experience he can from the senior generals. Let's see how meticulously The Thunderbolt strikes this time.*
