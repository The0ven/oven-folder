A growing power in central [[Selfalora]]. Once part of Valbaneea-Thrench, a union between itself and [[Valbaneea]]. Thernik has recently leased a few thousand soldiers to the Valbaneean forces in the [[War of Three Kings]], as well as expanded into the collapsing nation of [[Simul]] which has brought some conflict between them and the [[Valtir-Het]]. Thernik is bordered to the north by the [[Great Mountains]], the east by Simul, the South by Valbaneea, and the west by [[Jangaraja Empire]].
