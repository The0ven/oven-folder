# Reclaiming the Lost Throne
With the collapse of the Da Chu and the death of the last Wu inheritor, the Zhao have fallen into chaos. Murmurs of a second Zhao civil war have begun, with some of the ancient families emerging from the wordwork on the lips and ears of citizens. Dongjing is silent, few mill about the streets as fear has reached a fever pitch.

*Meanwhile, in the Xie city of Nanzheng, a plot is being brewed. Lady Wei of the Xie sits across from the Rek, her arms folded.*

"You promise us great prosperity, and our trade has multiplied while under your protection, however we see what has been happening in [[Awalentse]] and worry that the Jia people will fall to the same fate. Across the former Da Chu tensions are about to boil over, involving ourselves may be the last mistake we make."

"It is precisely because of what has happened in Awalentse that I have come to you with this proposal Lady Wei. We do not want to see a second Zhao civil war, just as you and all of the Jia people and leaders. However, if we do not act quickly, it is not a matter of if but *when* a civil war breaks out. And I assure you, your borders will be threatened by these new powers. It is better to strike while we still can, you and your line are the most legitimate claimants to the Zhao throne. Come now, together we will forge a new path, a brighter path, out of this dark period for the Jia people."

*Days later, a massive procession arrived in Dongjing. As people left their daily lives for a second to congregate around it. Whispers echoed throughout the courtyard of rumours of what this could mean. When Lady Wei stepped out, there was at first silence. Then her speaker stepped out behind her and read of a decree:*

"With the death of the Wu line, the sole existing heir to the Zhao throne is the Xie family. Lady Xie Wei has arrived to claim the throne of the Zhao, and reunite the Jia people for the first time since the onset of the civil war."

*The silence hung in the air for a moment, then a few cheers came. Slowly, they spread until the courtyard was abuzz with celebration. Onlookers swarmed the lady, and she greeted each in time.*

*Not an hour later, a man left the capital on horseback, galloping quickly through the country side. He arrived at the Huang capital, where he relayed the message that the Xie had seized the nation through a crack in an old cement wall. All he got in response was a defeated wheeze, then two quick raps, knuckles against the wall. He accepted the order with his own two knocks, and rode off west, towards the old Wu lands...*
