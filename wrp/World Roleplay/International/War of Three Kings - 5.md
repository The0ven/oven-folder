[[War of Three Kings - 5 - Zavar]]
[[War of Three Kings - 5 - Valbaneea]]

## Maris Naval Siege
*An important port for the [[Valbaneea]]n alliance, the [[City of Maris]] has been a target of pirate aggression since the outset of the war. The anti-piracy fleet had been able to more or less fend off the besieging ships and protect its harbor, though an effective sea blockade had been created. That is, until now. While the Maris fleet attempts to repair and rebuild after the disaster that was its first engagements against the pirates, reinforcements from [[Zavaria]] arrive. This massive fleet essentially doubles the size of the besieging armada, and so the Zavarian alliance is finally able to begin a true assault.*

*The dawn breaks and the sky is blood red, the yellow sun stained red by smoke rising from a massive pyre burning at the center of the harbor. Werth II was awoken by panicked watchmen, urging him awake. He stumbled sleepily out to his balcony overlooking the city and feel to his knees. The fleet had failed. The pirates were here. Red and Black banners whipped in the air as the ships drifted around the harbor. A few had already made land and Werth could hear the bloodcurdling screams of the harbor garrison being massacred by the pirates. He turned around, instructing the watchmen to ready his combat gear and vomited onto the floor of his room. Steadying himself against the bed he prepared his mind for what was to come. He would not give in, Maris was his home. He must save his home from the dread pirates of [[Karlo Mavarax]]...*

## [[Riveria]] Falters
*The Riverian defenders have proven their mettle against the [[Trifarix Legion]], holding them back along the road line for a short time. However, the might of the legion and their overwhelming size proves too much for the Riverians. Try as they might, the town of Sjever's meager defenses crumble at the tip of the Serpent's Fangs. The Legion splits, some heading north into Valbaneea, where they continue to rebuke defenders until reaching Serpiente and some doubling back to Navoria to relieve the siege. They face major resistance along their way, barely able to make it halfway to the city in trouble. A final section of the legion splits south, towards Xerelan. There they meet **(a seemingly small portion of)** the [[Vistadorada]]n troops and the two armies begin to advance into the Riverian capital.*

"My liege, my liege, they are here! The Vipers are here! They have come for our heads we must depart at once!"
*Avaram of Xerelan raised his head, his old eyes deep set into a face marred with lines. He sat up, coughing, and faced the captain of the garrison.*
"I've heard my grandson intends to fight in the south. It would be a disservice to him to not whittle down as many of these men as possible before they reach him. My brave captain, I am too old to fight but I have led Xerelan for many years and I will not abandon her today. Come, we must go now to rally our defenses..."

*As the invaders descend on the jungle city, the Xerelani all pitch in to aid in the defense of their home. Peasantry take up arms against legionnaires, and with the local garrison they move together as one, darting down streets and through groves they know as the backs of their hands. The invading force greatly outpowers them, but their numbers are great and their advantage strong. Without defining walls to protect the city sure it is vulnerable but the jungle also roams wild throughout the city allowing for the defenders to confuse and trap many of the invaders. Ultimately however, the forces are defeated due to the simply overwhelming strength of the legion and Vistadoradans. The Trifarix capture Avaram, the old man reportedly even swung at his captors with a hidden dagger while being detained. Truly a turning point in the war and even in Riveria's history, the capital has fallen but not without the greatest fight the duchy could muster.*

## A Saving Grace
*[[City of Dragulj]] and [[City of Vikend]] lay on the horizon for the Valban and Riverian troops marching East. Two armies march, the smaller front armies and reinforcements who passed through Maris only days before its siege began. The front army has met some resistance from the city states' local armies, but have managed to continue forwards towards the cities relatively well. After they were heavily delayed at first, the troops now approach Dragulj. This is an important supply point for the Valbaneeans to capture as its central placement would allow them to control the most important roads in the [[Mavaria]]n road system. The forwards army now faces a large resistance from a combination force of the city states' army and new reinforcements from the nearby town of Tori. Multiple clashes breakout along the roads as the Valbaneean troops react strategically to minimize their casualties and simply stall until their reinforcements arrive. This takes longer than expected, but when they do arrive the troops are heavily reinvigorated; apparently they had just achieved a great victory on their travels...*

*About halfway between Maris and the Riveria's border the troops met an army of Vistadoradan troops recently disembarked and heading for Xerelan. Engaging with these troops, their much greater numbers allowed them to overwhelm the force and decimate them, sending the few survivors scurrying off into the jungle north of the roadway. The troops confidently boast they had saved the capital...*

*Once the reinforcements had arrived, it was over for the southern city states. The troops marched efficiently towards the two cities, overwhelming the forces dispatched to delay them and besieging them. When news reached them that Maris was under attack there was worry; but when they heard of the fate of Xerelan there was both a deep sadness and a sudden hope. On one hand the troops faced the truth, they had failed to defend their homeland against the [[Holy Mavar State]]'s legionnaires, but they also were reminded of the undying spirit of the people. They fought more courageously and Zealously than ever. Within days Vikend had fallen and with only a few more Dragulj was theirs. Supplies were limited, Riveria had been greatly weakened, and the generals became worried the force was too large to sustain itself much longer so disconnected from the Valbaneean lands. Then, a saving grace came. Word from Navoria came, reinforcements had arrived to aid in the siege and as such a force was descending south. Scouts had reported movements to the east and west of the city but for now the direct center was safe, finally breathing a renewed life into the southern armies...*

## Navoria... Stands... Tall...
*The [[City of Navoria]] remains as the only city on either side of the war still in full control of itself. Somehow, the Navorians have worked together to repel attempted assaults for weeks. At this point, the Valbaneean troops had settled in, waiting out the entrenched defenders who rapidly realized their supplies were dwindling. After some time a large group of reinforcements arrive to join the siege, as the Zavar alliance scrambles to reroute troops from the [[Toro Tribes]] and the assault on Riveria. The new force readies itself for this counterattack by sending a group southwards to destroy supply trains heading east for the Trifarix and to get word to the southern army that a great force is converging on Navoria.*

*The armies from both sides converge on the force at Navoria, and a great battle ensues. The fighting rages on for multiple days and both sides have moments where it looks like they are about to gain absolute victory just to slide back to neutral. Eventually, in an ingenious move, the Trifarix use some animals captured over the course of the battle to create a distraction at night, as if a new wave of troops are arriving, and then split the Valbaneean troops who attempt to head off this new threat from the rest of the army. The force is cornered in the jungle and attempts to retreat but many are killed by the Vipers. The Valban forces, now outnumbered, retreat slightly south and east, into the weaker Toro army who are forced to retreat slightly themselves. The control over the road is maintained but the siege is forced to an end. The victorious Trifarix celebrate, overjoyed at their tactical brilliance and victory in such a pivotal moment...*

*However, upon entering the walls of Navoria they realize all is not well. While the city has survived, the battle raged on too long and the majority of the population has starved. The roads are scattered with emaciated corpses, flies picking at peeling skin and the air thick with the smell of rotting flesh. The worst is yet to come however, as they approach the keep at the center of the city the bodies become more bare, as if the muscle and fat had been wrested clean off the bone. Entering the keep, even the most steadfast soldiers of the legion shiver slightly with fear...*

*Noises can be heard from lord Huke's dining hall ahead and the captain goes first to survey any danger. There is an audible yell, a deep moan, and then the sound of a blade sliding through tissue. The captain returns with eyes wide as the moon and his face white as marble. Sheathing his bloodstained sword, he orders his troops to clean up the city remnants and dispose of the bodies in a mass grave. As the legion begins to collect bodies, one of the legionnaires gasps, exclaiming that the wounds in the Lady Huke look like those from a human's teeth...*![[three_kings2.png]]
