[[Bottanic's Recompense - 2 - Bottanic]]
[[Bottanic's Recompense - 2 - Nanacatl]]

## Result:
*Deep in the south of [[Nanacatl]], troops toil in the constructions of bridges spanning the jungle river. The large pontoon structures are built in camps on the east bank, then floated out across the river to form chains which troops can cross. The Nanacatl troops have been harassed by [[Bottanic Kingdom]]'s raiding parties, but overtime they have become more accustomed to the raiders. Now, the bridges are protected by a garrison force across the south, and when the bridges are being strung out they ensure all troops stationed on both sides of the river banks are ready to protect them. The raids do slow the efforts of the builders, but because they are prepared the casualties are turned against the raiders...*

*On the northern front, the story is similar. The Shamans use traditional spiritual plants to coax information from the captured Bottanic forces. This information allows them to locate and destroy a number of the raider groups as they prowl the dark jungle for Nanacatl camps. However, the forts stand stronger than ever, with reinforcements making up for any casualties from the first move. Now, the Bottanic raiders take a more offensive stance, again trying to raid the Nanacatl bridge projects. They do see some success, delaying the projects as in the south, but thanks to the use of the slaves the Nanacatl can outpace them and defend the camps better. The raiders' offensive strategy backfires, as their troops are repeatedly repelled and the Nanacatl are able to capture more for information and labor. The Bottanic do have further success deeper into the jungle, stopping the Nanacatl troops from felling even one fort and all around holding the lines deeper into the heart lands.*

*With moderate successes in the north and south, the Nanacatl have been emboldened to try and break the forts near the forking of the river, allowing them access into the Bottanic heartland. In the black of night, small boats carrying the forces row across the water, approaching a hidden camp where other Shamanic Guard lie in wait. After some preparation and planning, the forces set out west towards the two forts. The defenders are startled as the loud howling of the warhowls. The sound, amplified by the large number of soldiers creating it, is nauseating for the Bottanic defenders and extremely disorienting. Taking advantage of this, the troops begin to attack the fort from all sides, the disoriented defenders struggling to find anything past the fort in the dark while the lights from inside provide a beacon for the Nanacatl to flock to. The first fort falls after around two hours of fighting, but the other holds on long enough for dawn to break. With the light the battle flips, the attackers now easy targets for the archers, who rain death upon them and force them to retreat...*

*For now, the war remains at a standstill. The Nanacatl are able to supply their troops and the Bottanic able to hold against these aggressors. The roaring tide of war is now a light squall in the breeze... waiting to be turned...*
