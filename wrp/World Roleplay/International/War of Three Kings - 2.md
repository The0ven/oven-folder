[[Mavir River]]
# Result:
Both the [[Zavaria]]n and [[Valbaneea]]n troops move to the western side of the map with large groups of archers, who begin to send barrages across the water. Suddenly, the Valbaneeans begin to rush down into the river! While the Zavarian pirates pick some off with their crossbows, the bows are slow to reload and each is only able to get off about three arrows before the Valbaneean forces meet the land again. The spearmen attempt to form a phalanx and stop the advance, but the Valbaneean force overwhelms them from the sides and forces them back, into the archers behind them. Despite taking heavy casualties, the Valbaneean forces descend on the chaotic Zavarian line and destroy them. Back across the river, the Valbaneean troops have been chopping down trees and creating log bridges over the river's narrower point, allowing reinforcements to arrive for those who crossed the river with less risk. Meanwhile in the south east, the Jungle Rangers cross the river to prepare their ambush, and are joined by a large force of pirates and spearmen. The Jungle Ranger ambush begins first, taking the soldiers focused on chopping logs in the area by surprise and allowing them to kill many before reinforcements from the Valbaneean ranks arrive. The skirmish escalates into an all out brawl on the eastern side of the river as the evenly matched forces clash. With the bridge completed, some Valbaneeans cross to join those who rushed over the river and together they progress south where a second battle begins. Almost all troops are now actively battling on one side of the river or the other and the carnage continues as the regrouped Zavarian forces begin attacking the Valbaneean advance from a new angle.
