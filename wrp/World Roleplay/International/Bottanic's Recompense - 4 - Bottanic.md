***Banseth's Revengeance***

*"It is time to wreak havoc. It is time to show what we, the Bottanicans are capable of. And we, my men, WE are capable of DESTRUCTION!"

*Thus it began. King Van Kar Banseth the Cruel prepared raiding groups and assembled his army to devastate the [[Nanacatl]], again. 

*Previous raidings had brought him some good booty. However, the Nanacatl invasion have instilled in him a sense of bitterness. King Banseth now has a malevolent goal: He wishes to torment these shroomers. He wants to bring hell to the home of an average Nanacatli*

**He wants Vengeance**

```Securing the North:```
*Our military goals will be to eliminate the Nanacatl on our side of the river in the north completely. (Those tiny brown spots on the map.) After that aim is accomplished, Landings to the other side of the river will begin. This will officially start our struggle to recapture our fortresses and territory. The centre of the Northern forts will be attacked and subsequently sieged down by the combined forces of [[Bottanic Kingdom]] and [[Vistadorada]]. Once the three forts that are marked on the map (red) are taken over, The forts on the left side will be an easy grab due to destruction of supply lines and the consequential encirclement.*

**Sack of Tlan Lutali and the Wrath of Banseth:**
*King Banseth will lead the offensive on Nanacatl soil in the south. Passing the river and upon reaching a sizeable settlement, he will divide his forces into raiding parties and task them to ransack all the villages & towns in the immediate vicinity. 

*The Chief himself will lead an army of 4,000 to sack the crucial coastal city of Tlan Lutali. This city is strategically located on the coast and is possibly a major harbor for the Nanacatl. This will be an important operation. The aim is absolutely devastate the city. This is not going to be a siege; it is a raid on a mass-scale. Similar to the sack of Rome. 

*Banseth specifically orders his raiders to steal the Nanacatl's women, Burn down their houses, kill their men and steal their children.*

*`"Commit hideous and atrocious acts on their women and men alike. Unleash your inner demons! Let your rage out! Cut the genitals of their men! Hang their bodies on the trees as a testament to my WRATH!!!"`*

*Banseth is a monster. And monsters like him are the best at psychological warfare. These acts will be demoralizing the Nanacatl to the core.*
