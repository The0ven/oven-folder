# Result:
## Southern Battle:
The Zavarian troops falter under the pressure of the massive Valbaneean force and the center begins to retreat north. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Valbaneean forces attack through the middle, splitting the forces while creating a counter flank towards the river to prevent the southern Zavarian from flanking along the riverbank. Unfortunately for them, their rushing into the center proves a horrible mistake, as the Zavarian soldiers form a deadly phalanx to the north from the feigned retreat and begin to push press into the poorly guarded northwestern flank of the Valbaneean forces. Sandwiched between the dense jungle, river, and Zavarian forces to their north and south, all hope seems lost for the southern Valbaneean troops. Many start to rout and are pelted with arrows as they retreat across the river, which runs red with Valbaneean blood...
## Northern Battle:
Knowing their outlook is not good, the northern Zavarians retreat into the jungle as the ambush's effect wears off and the Valbaneeans regroup to fight back. During their tactical retreat a small flank from the north is encountered, but after some fighting the jungle rangers are able to dispatch of them. The Valbaneeans are weary to enter the jungle, and most remain and wait in the open plains, watching the forest carefully. A group of raiders do push into the forest, and manage to deal some decent damage to the Zavarians but are ultimately repelled and forced to flee back to the main force. A stalemate begins...
