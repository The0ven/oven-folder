#warmove 
[[Nanacatl]] 
[[Bottanic Kingdom]]

Ok no warmove, im basically gonna just defend the wall of encampments down south, and the forts i usurped from battanic. Just incase they counter-attack, meanwhile im gonna replenish my forces. Establish patrols with the shamanic guard, to act as a forward observation force, mainly operating out of the fort we took last warmove. If they do a massive push in the undefended area, i plan on just retreating and forcing their army deeper into the jungle while i encircle.
