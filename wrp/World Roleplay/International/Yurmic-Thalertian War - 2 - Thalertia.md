`"What a waste! Here I was, eagerly looking for a fight, a thrilling adventure to clash my sword! But! I get nothing!"`

*Dhananjay complains like the brat he is. His words could be heard outside his tent. The captains of the mercenary company have grown a bit familiar with their young owner's occasional childish ramblings.

*One of the captains who is present inside the camp and witnesses the young man grumble, Lets out a simple ~sigh~*

`"The enemy is playing defensively, Their underhanded tactics are buying time and exhausting our will to fight."`

*The captain explains to the individuals present in the room.

*Dhananjay who is sitting on a chair with his feet lying comfortably on the wooden table, silently watches the tent's ceiling with his eyes.*

*`"HMMMMMMM"`*

*All the individuals in the room observe the awkward silence. 

*It is at that moment, that a soldier arrives inside the tent.*

`"My lord, Your father—his lordship Dharmanandana—has sent us supplies and boats."`

*Dhananjay's eyes are locked on the tent's ceiling. He barely flinches at the soldier's announcement. 

*Rest of the group also pays little attention to the soldier's words.

*It is then, that a idea struck Dhananjay.*

`"...Boats! That's it! Yes...Ofcourse! Why did I not think about this earlier?"`

*Dhananjay exclaims as his fist slams on the table out of reverence. The group of captains and generals look at the young man's renewed enthusiasm with curiousity; With a single thought in mind.*

`"What is the devil thinking?"`
***——————————————————————————————————————————————————————***
*`In the jungle's heart, the thunderbolt's art, swift as lightning, a master's part. Illuminate the way, night and day, thunder's sway, no delay.`*

*Dhananjay's main goal in the ongoing campaign is to achieve victory with swiftness and glory. As someone who has grown in a noble House of administrators, Dhananjay thinks like a steward or an architect. His approach may seem unconventional to the battle-hardened militarymen but his forethought is by far very robust in strategy. 

*Dhananjay's plans are simple and grounded; utilization of the available resources and maximize the results.

*Thanks to his father—The allied force has nigh absolute supremacy in the Kaveritara (Xhepaliks) river. Currently, the Yurmeich have taken up a defense approach in the northern front and have stalled his advance. Knowing that this will be a waste of time and his force will likely receive damages when trying to advance through such defenses—Dhananjay decides that he will instead bring the fight to the other side of the river. The South. 

*Utilizing the overwhelming number of vessels, Dhananjay begins to transport a major portion of his army to the south and specifically onto the settlement of Érlaunra. He will bring his own mercenary company (3,000) alongwith 4,000 of the Thalert's military. (Totaling to 7,000). 

*Meanwhile the remaining forces in the north will dig up their own defenses and camp. Resulting in the freezing up of this front entirely.*

*With __lightning__ speed and __overseeing__ the __organization__ of the army __himself__, Dhananjay would launch a direct assault on the present enemy forces' in the region. His army would be combined with the pre-existing Thalert's army (estimated to be around 2,000-3,000) to gain numerical supremacy.

*The naval supremacy on the Kaveritara river is a great source of supplies and will provide the young man with enough resources to support his military manuervers and swift advances. 

*Dhananjay has not yet given up on his goal of reaching Yurmeich. He has only changed the route for getting to the city. His next target is Háyealsk, which would become a launchpad for a future amphibious assault.*

*```Depending on the success of this manuerver and military successes, Dhananjay Vajravarta will gain the nickname "the Thunderbolt" for LARP purposes. Logger can enlarge on this.```*
