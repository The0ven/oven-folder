Čarlotte, House of Corbeaux-Tyranno, was the king of Valbaneea from 464 ASL to 507 ASL. As a studious young man, Čarlotte was a diplomat for [[Valbaneea]] and highly educated. However, after his father died, he was to be coronated as King of Valbaneea. With a multitude of expansions, Čarlotte quickly became one of the greatest kings, if not the greatest, of Valbaneea. At a point, with the allied state of [[Thernik Union]], had formed a personal union that he was popularly elected as their king. However, as Valbaneea-Thernch collapsed due to the war with [[Jangaraja Empire]] and multiple complications, Čarlotte was made a fool. This war had some rather unwarranted side effects, making the nations of [[Nanacatl]], Janagaraja, Valbaneea-Thernch (Xhepaliks,) and [[Xamenlia]] go into war. Unfortunately, this would cause a collapse to the Spice Road which had made much of the [[Mavaria]]n Economy. 

When [[Kavar of Maris]] was assassinated, the Mavar states split due to economic failures. Cut back to Čarlotte, he was then coronated by popular decision AGAIN as Duke of [[Riveria]] (including [[City of Maris]] and [[City of Navoria]], albeit they were lead by “lord mayors” like Huke), now inheriting two titles to Corbeaux-Tyranno.

Now that the states had split, one state in particular rose. The [[Navarre]] Republic.

Ruled by [[Karlo Mavarax]], descendant of the Mavarax Family which cruelly ruled Mavaria, was a pirate nation full of bandits and the like. Karlo was the sworn enemy of Čarlotte, as was Čarlotte was to Karlo. 

Čarlotte eventually won the war after Karlo fled and a series of victory had repelled most of the pirates, capturing all of Navarre's ships and taking them as their own. However, controversially had allowed for the Massacre at Zavkor to happen killing 9k people (uh oh, it’s a casus-belli!!!!)

Humiliated by the massacre, Čarlotte faked his death and went into self-exile in Xamenlia, where he lived the last of his days in peace.
