# All is Lost in Search of Revenge
*Following the catastrophic defeat at the hands of the mysterious new weapon in [[Nanacatl]], the [[Bottanic Kingdom]]'s' forces retread back across the river. No attempt to follow them is made, the creeks of the west still poisoned with the lingering poisons unleashed by Nanacatl. Aurelius takes the meager victory, scraping up what is left of the population in his retreat. The few remaining forces are able to occupy the mostly ruined strip of land from the border to the [[Jangaraja Empire]]. However, this does provide the Bottanic Kingdom with valuable access to the Amaris Lake. Nanacatl is forced to abandon the west, the population all but destroyed and the land sick. Instead, they focus on reinforcing their central lands in the east, and stopping any further raids from their neighbours. The war is over, but it is long from forgotten. Between the massacre of western Nanacatl at the hands of Bottanic and Jangaraja, and the unleashing of the mind virus by Nanacatl, historians for centuries mark Bottanic's Recompense as a horrific change in [[Selfalora]]. Both nations come out of the war, but both heavily scathed by the torments of battle.*
