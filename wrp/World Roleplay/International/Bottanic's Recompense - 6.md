[[Bottanic's Recompense - 6 - Bottanic]]
# For Whom the Bell Tolls

*[[Nanacatl]] was collapsing. From every front, [[Bottanic Kingdom]]  forces were making gains further and further into the jungle. The shamanic guard had met with Israel, and together they had decided to do what must finally be done. Overnight a group of shamans travelled to each front, taking forests or hidden routes when they were nearing enemy territory. Upon arriving at the battles they consulted with the generals leading the troops there, discussing with them the details of this secret plot. As the sun began to crest the horizon and the skies glowed pink and the many fronts resumed battle, the greatest weapon of the Nanacatl was deployed...*

*Woldog could barely contain his joy. His army had single headedly captured a number of the northern settlements, forcing the undersupplied shroomers back with ease. Today he would capture Tlateloco, an important city connecting the east and west fronts that had managed to hold out against his normal siege tactics. He wiped down his axe blade, polishing it until it gleamed like new. He stepped out of his war tent and rallied his men. Quickly, the elite guard was ready, with the other troops ready soon after. He spoke to his men.*

"OUR ENEMIES ARE ON THEIR LAST RATIONS! WE HAVE CONQUERED CITIES LIKE THIS MANY A TIME OVER THIS CAMPAIGN, AND WE WILL DO SO AGAIN! SHOULD WE DO WELL THIS MAY BE OUR FINAL BATTLE! WE WILL WIN THIS DAY MEN!"

*Woldog's axeblade glinted in the pink dawn as he shook his weapon in the air. His troops mimicked him and blade after blade was hoisted high in unison.*

*The battle was going well, the elite axemen cutting through the weakened army with ease while the shield bearers and spearmen advanced relentlessly. As they began to reach the walls, a call for a battering ram came and within minutes the large wooden doors were shaking and creaking as they strained to hold against the bashing. A loud horn rung out from within the city, and many of the Nanacatl troops froze, many of those being cutdown as they were distracted. A bluish haze set in over the battlefield, wafting from the city walls quickly. Several braziers were blazing, and men with fans forced the smoke out and down. Woldog was near the center of the battle, but he saw as the men at the front reacted. Some collapsed to their knees, others doubled over and began to vomit, others still dropped their blades and pounced on the nearest man; attacking with a flurry of blows. The smoke moved quickly, carried partially by the breeze as well as the fans, and Woldog began to turn. Covering his face with his tunic he tucked his axe back into his belt and began running from the smoke, not looking back. As he neared the edge of the battle, a hand grabbed his ankle and he fell, his face striking the ground. He rolled over and saw one of his elite guard, a high ranking lieutenant he knew personally, gripping his boot with a crazed look in his eyes. The man lept at him, his teeth sinking into Woldog's cheek and tearing flesh from it. Woldog grabbed at the man's belt, unfastening a dagger from its sheath and pulled it between them. As the man dove in again, the blade pierced his chest and his eyes shot wide, almost entirely black, his jaw lurched open and he let out a hiss of breath before falling limp to the side. Woldog stood, grabbed the dagger, and continued to run. He reached the jungle edge and continued, running for hours until he found a small stream where he stopped and made camp with what he could.

*Across all fronts, the central command of Battanic heard nothing. After a few days, scouts were sent to determine the status of the war. Surely they had not lost? The scouts would not return for two weeks, and when they did they came in sparse number and with shock completely set in their eyes. The ones who survived were barely able to whimper out a report on the horrors they'd seen, men turning against each other, entire armies driven mad in the midst of battle or after a meal while camped out. No one was sure how many remained, although those who had escaped the grasp of madness were extremely few and spread out across an unfamiliar jungle...*![[bott_nan6 2.png]]
