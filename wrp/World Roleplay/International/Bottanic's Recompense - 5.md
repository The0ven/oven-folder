[[Bottanic's Recompense - 5 - Bottanic]]

# Brightest Day Comes...
*The [[Nanacatl]] forces were exhausted from weeks of constant stalemate. This morning was like any other, both sides testing the waters before deciding against an advance. The Nanacatl sat in their forts day in and day out, waiting for any sign of the [[Bottanic Kingdom]]'s raiders attempting to cross the river. Through the morning nothing happened, and most of the defenders resumed various games and past times to scare off boredom. As the sun crested its highest point, whispers of an attack from the north began to spread. Eventually, the commanders gathered together privately, and decided that they would send a small force to report back, as they had not had any communication from them. The sun slowly began to drop back towards the horizon, and suddenly the tide changed. Cries were heard from across the ramparts, yelling out calls of invasion. Men scrambled to the lookout points, but the sun was shining directly over the battlefield and into their eyes. Attempts were made to fire on the crossing raiders, but they proved ineffective, cutting down very few Bottanic troops.*

*Aurelius roared, driving his blade under the breastplate of a heavy trooper from Nanacatl. Pulling it from the fleshy sheath, he sliced across the throat of another, slamming his full weight into the body and sending it tumbling into other soldiers. The Bottanic troops overwhelmed the Nanacatl quickly, reaching the central forts and besieging them. The defenders tried desperately to hold off, but their forces were spread too thin across the lines of forts and the center fell. The supply across the peninsula was strained and Aurelius took advantage of this, leading a split-off army north to capture the remaining river forts. These fell too, many shroomers surrendering, knowing they could not resist the overwhelming attack. Aurelius celebrated, but knew the war was not yet won...*

# ...Before Darkest Night
*Tlan Lutali was abuzz, the entire town dedicated to supplying the brave forces sat defending it. Supply deliveries along the main roads had thinned but the worried commanders had not let this detail slip into public knowledge. They knew this was likely due to Bottanic raiding parties, but couldn't risk diverting troops from the front to protect the caravans. Slowly, the waiting game became too much for them. The Nanacatl troops were beginning to starve, so a group of shamanic guard were sent to scout the Bottanic positions. Upon returning they informed the generals that the estimated force of Bottanic in the south had been greatly overestimated. The generals convened, and decided the next night they would launch an all out attack on the Bottanic, forcing them back over the river. They gathered their forces the next evening, watching as the underfed men prepared. The attack began, troops marching through jungle paths towards their enemy. As they marched, some troops noticed whispers in the trees. Then, soldiers on various marches disappeared into pits, or yelped in pain as they stepped on thorns strewn across the road. As the force tried to reorganize, checking for traps now, the real trap was unleashed. Emerging from ever direction of the forest Bottanic raiders, adorned with green paint across their skin, screamed a battle cry in unison. Axes, swords, and spears flashed, moonlight glinting off their steel blades. Nanacatl troops fell by the hundreds, their armour crumpling easily under the force of the blows. True chaos set in among the Shroomers, some commanders calling for retreat while others demanded their troops continue to kill as many Bottanic as they could. Shouting overlapped with the moist squelches of pierced flesh. Ultimately, few Nanacatl troops were able to survive the massacre. Some Bottanic soldiers began to collect the steel weaponry of their fallen enemies, but found it extremely brittle and mostly already broken. The commanders ordered them to leave it, claiming it was worthless...*
### Casualties: 
**Bottanic:**
	1,020 Troops
**Nanacatl:**
	4,230 Killed

# The Darkness Deepens
*The war had been in a stalemate since its onset, both sides relatively evenly matched. Now, the tide was changing. Nanacatl had lost all its advances into Bottanic, and had lost land even within their own territory. Banseth the Cruel was overjoyed, as much as he could be. His raiders had proven their worth above a simple raiding force, it was known now that they were one of the most effective groups of jungle warriors around. However, there was no denying that the wars had taken their toll on Bottanic and Banseth. He now wanted one thing, to see the Nanacatl pay. He gathered messengers, sending out communications to his generals north of his army while he prepared his forces. Reinforcements had arrived from the south, and the devastating massacre against the armies advancing from Tlan Lutali had given them a massive boost in morale. Once the messages were sent Banseth slept peacefully, dreaming of the carnage that would come the next day.*

*Banseth was now standing at the center of Tlan Lutali. Around him, pyres burned. His forces had overwhelmed the already demoralized and partially destroyed defenders, although they had been prepared thanks to the few escapees of the massacre. The battle had not gone on long, but was bloody for both sides. Banseth stopped reminiscing and looked in front of him. There sat hundreds of women and children, shackled together. Littered around the village were the rotting bodies of the men, some who had tried to fight back and even those who had surrendered. Banseth, revelling in the look they gave him as they begged for their lives and families to be spared. A messenger arrived for Banseth, and he read the letter from his northern allies. The attacks had been carried out, villages across the lake and river burned as Tlan Lutali did. Wonderful, he thought, now these disgusting shroomers will see the errors of their ways...*
