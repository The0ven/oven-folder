**Israel IV's revenge**

With the end of the Great Silencing, the Mandate has been a sleeping giant. In a slumber, taken over by turmoil domestic and foreign, with trade in [[Mavaria]] being disrupted by their '[[War of Three Kings]]', and [[Empire of The Horocians]]'s offensive within [[Jangaraja Empire]] stalling and being futile, Israel IV's reign has been marked by a great disturbance, yet he has managed to contain [[Nanacatl]] and ensure that no foreign threat endangers its civilians.

`This has changed.` 

The Battanic People had been exiled from Horocia, and had decided to settle down within the frontier, they have colonized and centralized the frontier, a plan thought impossible by the former council, which Israel had purged. But this isn't the only concern, they are savages, having annihlated a colony which was jointly setup between Mavaria and the Mandate, thousands of devout followers have seem to either fled, 'assimilated' or been killed. This was a spark to light the flame, and then had started the raids.

`The Invasion` 

Israel IV is to levy a 25,000 Large Army, contracting blacksmiths, amassing elephants, water oxen, and priests as spiritual guidance, Israel IV and the warband are to undergo a large spritiual ceremony to be blessed by the gods in their campaign. The shamans are to be gathered from cities across the Mandate, mainly Yancuitlan. And they are to march to Tlan Iutali and camp out there, while Israel sets up his battle plans.

Scouting parties which total in around 2,000 Shaman Guard are to be sent into the Battanic lands, following the river banks and infiltrating towns and cities, taking note of defenses, natural landmarks, and local fauna/temperature/animals that may hamper operations. Once they return, the invasion is to begin.

Admiral Ichcotzin will take control of the 200 Ship Large navy, which had been in development for a better half of a century, and sail down the river providing transport, blocking any naval response, and annihlating coastal cities/towns.
