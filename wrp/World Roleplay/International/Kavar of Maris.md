Kavar of Maris was a son of M’Kavar (M’ means like “Senior”) who was General of [[Trifarix Legion]] during the last Trifarix Council, and served Medvjed the Wise during the Speech of 410 ASL and turned the nation into a dictatorship. Now Kavar followed in his footsteps and became the youngest General of Trifarix Legion, and then took the role of the leader after Medvjed had a seizure. During his time [[Mavaria]] had 2 crusades on Azuria and helped [[Xamenlia]] to defeat [[Simul]] in the Simulian Conquest of 458 ASL. He was killed by Huke of [[City of Navoria]] in a plot made by Kurlon Zavar in 479 ASL. Currently he is the last person who ruled United Mavaria.
