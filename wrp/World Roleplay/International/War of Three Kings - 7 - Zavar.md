# 1. To the [[Mavir River]]!

Because of advancing enemy forces from the east, the generals order a retreated to Mavir river, making logged and piked fortification on our side of the western side of the river, the troops in Zavkor are ordered to retreated, alongside what ever civilians they are, as general and one of high ranking pirates decided to burn down Zakvor, saying: ‚ÄúWe wont give [[Valbaneea]]ns enjoyment of sacking Zavkor twice, and we can afford it as it didn't much recover in last 30 years since the sacking‚Äù 

(Basically in prelude war that happened between Valbaneea and pirates some 30 years ago, basically Valbaneeans took the city, went drunk, and sacked the city, leaving a their public image as ‚ÄúDefenders of Mavir Realm agaisnt The Pirates‚Äù in dismay, now they are marching there again)

With the loss on the Mavir front and retreat from our northern troops, we will make multiple  blockaded on the thin Part of the Mavir river, either by Dams made out of wood or just filling the driver with heavy debris 

Our Goals are to make their river fleet pause, giving an opening for our archers and pirate crossbowmen to rain down with fire arrows 

if their ground troops try to attack our archers, then they will push back into the jungles and our jungle rangers and pirates with shields will do Human Kebab tactics by trapping them from north and south side, closing in in it and making them clustered in small space, troops would be stationed at both sides of the River.

The pirates on the coast we'll get onto their ships (95 ships i think?) and form a sea blockade, if Valbaneeans and [[Xamenlia]]ns feel enough bold to push our river defences, the Pirates will flank them from the side, either by crossbow  with fire arrows or by naval landings.

The [[Zavaria]]n fleet will sail to join the East Pirate fleet (around 80 Zavar Ships) ‚Ä¶ if i remember from Xamenlian larps, they barely have a navy as they are living as one with the jungles‚Ä¶ heck they will great rivals to my Jungle Rangers‚Ä¶even better,..im fucked

With additional troops raised (in the last wramove) additional 5.5k Mavars from [[Holy Mavar State]] will join on that defensive front alongside so i do have enough troops ...uf but too many levies‚Ä¶ at least i will be on defensive here, probably the best option for using levies.

- 4,180 Jungle Rangers, 
- 3,750 pirates on land
- 2,1k Pirates on Ships
- 2k [[Toro Tribes]] levies
- 2,4k Lord Vivo‚Äôs [[Navarre]] levies
- 5,5k Mavar Levies
ALL: 19,930k‚Ä¶ half are levies jesus

# 2. Establishing road communications and control over [[Riveria]]

With a great but costly victory in Xeralan, all Riverian and most of Xamenlian troops were eradicated in the region, so re-establishing our supply chains will be important, as it would be foolish to march north with our supply chains to be easily cut off.. So cities of Tori, Xeralan, Sjever, Dragulj and Vikend will first be refortified, Jungle Rangers will send a few of their men as scouts into the north, to locate marching enemy troops and warn any nearby army camp. Sjever will be key as it is on the front, so we plan to refortify it just like we tried Serpiente, hoping this time we will have enough time to finish our defences..

As for [[City of Navoria]], around 40 jungle rangers will be stationed outside the city and monitor it.. The city is already a near ruin and many corpses could prove a potential plague zone, if Valbaneeans want it‚Ä¶ well better for them to get sick and be haunted by Kartlun‚Äôs ghost (yes Army now made a song how Kartlun now haunts any enemy that tries to enter or take the city)

- 5.5k [[Trifarix Legion]] (yes that how many have left üò≠)
- 370 [[Vistadorada]]ns
- 4k Jungle Rangers
- Any possible new raised levy in Riveria? (1,300)
- 3k Levies from Toroland
ALL: 12,870k (14,170)

# 3. Werth II, we are coming for you!

Um well‚Ä¶ My whole army just now entered the [[City of Maris]]‚Ä¶ well our first goal is to kill any who resists and try to make every civilian who just wants to live to safely leave outside the city walls, but they will be checked first so any of their weapons could be taken away or that some high official in the city doesn't escape, as for Werth II, first and foremost he will be captured and brought next to his Uncle who is chained and held captive by Zavar soldiers‚Ä¶as they will face a trail (which i hope i can larp out)

- 3k pirates, 83 Pirate ships, 118 Mavar Jugs, 2,880 soldiers, 2k archers, 1.1k Levies, Sarah Mavarax, [[Karlo Mavarax]] and General Yuvan
