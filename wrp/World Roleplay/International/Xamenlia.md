Once a simple collection of tribes in south eastern [[Selfalora]], the Grand Domain of Xamenlia formed when Zerian's Cult took power in the Anidagi city state. Xamenlia was most prominent during the great age under Khisus I - III. They became closely entwined with [[Mavaria]], but after its collapse and the split of [[Valbaneea]] and [[Thernik Union]], they returned to their isolation. Following the collapse of [[Simul]], Xamenlia became the gateway to the east for nations like [[Jangaraja Empire]] and Valbaneea. These trade ties led to a formal alliance between The Xamenlians and Valbaneeans, which has now made them involved in the [[War of Three Kings]] against their old allies, now split. Xamenlia is bordered to the north east by Simul, the north west by Thrench, the west by Valbaneea, and the south by [[Navarre]].
