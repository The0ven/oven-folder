***Sack or Siege? Or Both***
*(Banseth is dead but I am gonna have him officially dead in the lore after this siege or whatever is over)

*Banseth's raiding party is capable of facing the shroomers in a open battle and slay them with delight. The only thing that needs to be done is employ a strategy to capture Tlan Lutali and eliminate its defenders. But ofcourse, that is not as easy as it sounds.*

*But remember, the one who rules the [[Bottanic Kingdom]] is Van Kar Banseth, "the Cruel"

*Banseth divided his raiding party into multiple smaller groups and ordered them to block and hunt down anyone who tries to use the roads to Tlan Lutali. All forms of supplies would be looted and non-combatants, specifically women and children, would be captured and enslaved. Meanwhile traveling men, If there are any, would be slain. 

*Expecting more reinforcements to come and lift this "barbaric siege" by Banseth, the Chief of Bottanica decides to employ some devious & devillish tactics. Banseth prepares his men to build traps such as digging hidden pits on the roads whilst building wooden or stone barricades for defensive positions. 

*The raiders will practice unconventional warfare and prepare camouflage near those routes to ambush and sabotage incoming reinforcements. 

*Banseth has full trust in the capabilities of his men, His strategy is to block reinforcements while starving the defending garrisons in Tlan Lutali...until the allied reinforcements themselves arrive to reinforce Banseth's ranks, After which the Chief will attack the city in a offensive operation. Unless, the city surrenders before that—which is a possibility.*

# MORNINGS GAZE

*Instead of waiting until morning to attack, Aurelius made the first move, ordering his men to fight on the very afternoon they crossed the river. This will put the Nanacatl at a disadvantage as they had to fight with the sun in their eyes. Yet, it will not be numbers that will win the day but discipline, cohesion, and leadership. It appears that Aurelius will have around 15,000 men. In contrast, the Nanacatl has at least smaller number of soldiers. Undaunted, the young king ordered his army to deploy near the East Wolenhs River. Aurelius placed his cavalry at the wings, and planning to use his famed infantry Jokhi armed with 2 metre Jangarajan pikes to overwhelm the Nanacatl mercenary soldiers. Aurelius tends to use cavalry on his flanks, charge with Jangarajan Manufactured Steel Spears Nancatl uses Low quality Jangarajan steel and we know that and Weapons towards the center of camp and trap the enemy between the charging cavalry and the infantry, mainly Bottanic Axus Fought.*

*`Tomfoolery?`*
Upon hearing the news of how badly the [[Nanacatl]] invasion of Bottanica is going, The Governors of the Jalādhar-Janapada and Amritābhūmi-Rajadhiraja were delighted. However, they could not pursue Jalapuram or the Maharāja to lend military support for a reconquista against the Nanacatl Mandate to retake all those territories along the Amaris Sarovara that was lost in the previous conflict which was cowardly started by the Nanacatl at a time when the [[Jangaraja Empire]] was unprepared. Yet, at this current hour, there is an opportunity clearly laid down infront of the Governors. Something must be done...

Something dirty? Something that would be unexpected? Something that can be beneficial?

The Bottanicans are known to be raiders...So...Yes.

A systematic ransacking operation to sow down the seeds of devastations in the Nanacatl. Around 5,000 men, most levies and ordinary folks, but with the inclusion of elite warriors, Would disembark from our lands and launch a marauding endeavour to pillage and destroy settlements in the enemy's territories. The aim of this armed force is to wreck havoc, Burn down villages, sack the towns and ravage supplies. To empower lawlessness and chaos.

Considering how indulged the Nanacatl is in its war against Bottanica, We expect this new menace to be quite the demoralizing activity. 

Since even their ships are quite busy, Some activity from the water is also welcomed. Calculated raids on lakeside towns and settlements will be undertaken.
