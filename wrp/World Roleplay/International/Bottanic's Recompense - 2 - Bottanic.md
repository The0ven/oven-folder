**[[Bottanic Kingdom]]'s Cruel King:**
*"So, these pests have put their men to work on building...bridges? Some sort of a...siege 'weapon'? HAHAHAHHA, Come on, this is just pathetic."*

```TARGETED AMBUSH```
*Chief Banseth has prepared raiding parties to take a good look at positions where bridges and military infrastructure is under construction. They will simultaneously start to sabotage those construction operations. The camps of military engineers on the western side of the river will be burned to the ground and enemy can expect heavy losses.*

*Fortunately, it seems the [[Nanacatl]] do not mind their hefty losses. It is a good thing that almost minimal effort has been put into dealing with the raiders. 

*We are going to completely fail their attempt at building the bridges. It is both illogical and waste of resources. Simply, boats might have been enough for this purpose but that's not our decision or problem; it presents an opportunity to hunt as many of their men and devastate their manpower pool.*
```ACCELERATED GUERILLA WARFARE```
*The enemy is entering our heartlands and is attempting a offensive from two sides. King Banseth is baffled; not at himself but at the audacity of the adversary. He himself will be giving orders to his hunting parties now.

*__Camouflage:__ "Hide in the bushes and prepare to ambush your foes" King Banseth instructs his men, The roads near the fortresses will be utilized by the enemy and this presents an opportunity to conceal archers & fighters alike, And attack when the situation is most favorable.*

*__Aggressive Guerilla:__ As more and more of the Chiefdom's levies are raised, It improves the size of Banseth's military. It is time to accelerate and unleash aggressive guerilla warfare against the enemy. There is much to say here, except the fact that their two puny offensives are going to end in a disaster. *

*And why is that? Because the total size of Banseth's military prowess will reach approximately 20,000 men now.*

***Offensive:***
*"Yes, indeed...It is time to impale these pests and I shall enjoy it with pleasure."

*King Banseth "the Cruel" may be a sadist, but he is one genius sadist. The Nanacatl are in a absolutely miserable position right now:*

*(Notes for the logger)
• The river is a geographical curse for the Nanacatl as it separates their armies between west and east. While trying to land their troops on the western side of the river, their casualities will hike at a rapid pace. *

*• As it is obvious, construction of bridges and military infrastructure takes time. And it would take infinity if our ambush attacks continue to destroy whatever little progress they make in their bridges or whatever infrastructure they seek to build in the deep jungles of our heartlands.*

*• Their numerical advantage is GONE. 9,000 + 7,000 = 16,000. 6,000 were killed beforehand, which leaves 4,000 men whom we expect to be employed for the purpose of constructing bridges and such (total force employed by the adversary for the invasion was 25,000). Now, this is a key detail. No reinforcements were sent. This is a recipe for disaster. It is indeed time to go on the offensive.*

*__The Offense:__ Now battles will be fought...But in our style, In the style of "Jungle Vikings".

*King Banseth will be leading his army and they will be going to attack the weakest force first, the ones who are coming to the south are numbered to be inferior in size by the scouts although both northern army and its southern counterpart don't have much size differences, It is better to fight the slightly weaker one nonetheless. *

*A number of guerilla charges into the enemy will be lead by Banseth's prideful commanders and chiefteins, Swinging their axes and pointy spears into the chests of the enemy's poor soldiers. These attacks will occur in waves, while utilizing guerilla to exhaust the enemy's numbers before a strong fighting force will arrive to engage the enemy in a jungle battle. It will be a disorganized fight due to the terrain, but one that we will certainly win. King Banseth hopes to slaughter whatever force was sent to capture the southern forts.*

***Reinforcing the northern and central garrisons:** *The forts must recieve reinforcements in the form of newly raised levies. All the forts have to survive these assaults, especially the northern ones. The garrisons in the northern and central forts will recieve higher quantities of new defenders, The garrison size of every fort in this region will rise to 2,000, A number we can and MUST sustain for the sake of Banseth's Kingdom.*

*(Note for the logger)
• Those shamans may be elites but how are they even going to attack the central fortifications without any bridges? I expect them to utilize boats, in which case:*

__**Hell from above:**__ *The forts are a excellent platform for the archers. Their location on the riverbanks is strategic and tactical, The archers are going to literally hunt whatever enemy fleet is found to be lingering around the forts. Hunting parties will be dispatched from the forts to survey the riverbanks and hunt down whatever prey has managed to land on the shore.*

**Turning the tide of war:**
*The [[Vistadorada]], reportedly, have accepted our call to arms. Their is now a strong hope to reclaim whatever territory we have lost to these shroomers. But the arrival of allied reinforcements will take its time, In this case, our Grand strategy is that we shall wait a little longer and eliminate whatever poor souls have landed on the western side of the river. 

As soon as Banseth's slaughter is complete, and as soon as the Sentinels of Vistadorads arrive, That is when we go to full offense.*

***The tide of war will change.**
