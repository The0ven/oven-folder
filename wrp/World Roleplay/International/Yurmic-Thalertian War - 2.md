# Tales of Turrenlel
*General Komtov stood around the war table with his lieutenants. The maps and blocks representing forces had been brushed to the side. Instead, they were replaced with a whole roasted boar and several cups of hearty mead. The officers sung out cheers in unison as Komtov stood, raising his glass in toast:*

"You, you are the soldiers of Yurmic! You have led your men, under my command, to victory surpassing even our own expectations. Your movements executed to perfection, your plans detailed to the second. You men, are the reason we have won the day! Word of our great escapades has travelled north, and stories of our swift victories have emboldened your fellow troops to fight this eastern menace. However, we must not rest on our laurels. We have had great success in the south but we have one final goal on this front. The capture of Frgon will come soon, just as the capture of Turrenlel did. Now, let us feast and celebrate today!"

*The officer, silent as their commander spoke, all raised their cups along with Komtov at his final word, shouts of celebration rising from the tent. Komtov was telling the truth, their attacks had been nothing short of spectacular, but they had one final obstacle to overcome. It was true too that the tales of their battles and prowess had reached the north and emboldened them. Would they be able to take Frgon with the ease of the south? Only time would tell...*

# Lightning Strikes...
*Dhananjay smiled as he stood at the bow of one of his ships, carrying him and his troops across the river. His plan was working, and the Yurmic were none the wiser. As he neared the shore however, his smile began to fade... The sounds of fighting could be heard ahead, but he was as yet unable to get a clear picture of what was happening due to the jungle brush. It was only moments until his ship shored up and he realized what was unfolding. His forces were engaging with a Yurmic army who had seemingly been surprised by the landings but were able to do damage as the troops came off their ships. Dhananjay jumped down and swung his polearm around his body, warming up before charging in.*

*Quickly, the Thalertian forces continued to land and it became obvious that they heavily outnumbered the Yurmic. The battle raged on for some time but the Yurmic were constantly thinning, retreating back until they had fallen back completely. The routing army was pursued but the jungle prevented an effective chase from ensuing.*

*Celebrating his first great victory, Dhananjay resupplied at Erlaunra, nursing the wounds of the bloody battle, and allowed the army to reorganize with the final ships completing the short trip across the river. Once the army was prepared, they continued Dhananjay's plan south and were able to advance towards Hayealsk, but were ambushed and fell upon traps constantly. Dhananjay's bolt had struck however, both into the Yurmic advance and into the hearts of the Yurmic troops, who now feared the mercenary leader known as the Thunderbolt...*
