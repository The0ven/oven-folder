Malakai is a nation based on an island of the same name. It is in the north of [[Valtoria]], with historical ties to the formerly independent [[Mitarilefon]], and the [[Latvin Empire]]. It is defined by its taiga/boreal biome, with deep, ancient forests. It's ruled in a Diarchy system, where two lineages of separate royal families co-rule, intermarrying on occasion to create balance but also allowing for marriages with local clans to for national unity. Its main export is its high quality Malakai lumber, often used in shipbuilding, though it also exports wolf and fox pelts, bear rugs, and other commodities.
