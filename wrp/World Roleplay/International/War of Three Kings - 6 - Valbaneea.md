## Xamenlia

**The Realm of [[Xamenlia]] — the Invasion**

*Iridescent sands shine show upon black, the sky split by a thick line which is the Ring of Arcanis. The Xamenli court isolates in the jungle, the death of Khisus still effecting the nation. Khisus, and the state of Xamenlia, was a close ally of the [[Valbaneea]]ns. A brotherhood formed after the Valbaneeans had filled the Xamenlian interests, their soldiers meeting.*

“Those stars,” *Okhbama spoke gathering clusters in his eyes with dissipation into his words.* “Until they are gone, the nation of Xamenlia shall be an ally to the Valbaneeans.”

*The Invasion*
Okhbama, Khisus III’s son, was a popular figure in Xamenlia and Selfalora. He was a tactician and general of the Xamenlian armies. Upon hearing of the [[Zavaria]]n and [[Holy Mavar State]]’s invasion of Valbaneea, he knew that they would try to target Kassadia if they had succeeded. It was time to step in and help their ally against the opposing forces, mostly for self-preservation of Kassadia and other fears such as pirates. 

10,000 men wake from the city of Kassadia, a walled city which stayed resilient during the Pirate Wars and now was under Xamenli Control. They are told that the Mavarians must be dealt with. The mobilize and take upon their personal items such as religious totems, armors from [[Jangaraja Empire]], bows, and spears, for each of these items represented important Xamenli values. Upon gearing, 7,000 men would make their march toward the coastal areas of Navarre whilst 3,000 held back upon the borders of Xamenlia. Making a great push forward, those 3,000 men would go attack and raid the forest that paled in comparison to the Xamenlian jungles. 

The standard Xamenlian unit included positioned bowmen and archers in the back, something that they were renown for across the entirety of [[Selfalora]] for their poison arrows, and also consisted of most Xamenlian troops. Troops in the front would generally be shield men and heavy infantry bearing spears. The formation was built to defend
-the valuable archery of Xamenlia which was so important.

Okhbama would lead his armies to the beaches of Navarre, doing coastal raids and fighting with a doctrine of speed to quickly ensure victories. This was a valuable strategy as it would allow for Xamenli troops to interrupt the pre-occupied Mavar forces and made it easier for them to gain supplies.

**Realm of Xamenlia - the Defense**

*A fragrant tea placed in a cup embroidered with Xamenli patterns sat gently on the wooden table’s edge, warm clouds forming above the liquid carrying the scent of flower. It rose in the chamber as Okhbama stared Čarlotte in a stern manner.*

“Son of Khisus, Crown Prince Okhbama,” *Čarlotte spoke to Khisus showing dignity. His voice was in a weaker tone and he struggled to formulate the*
Okh *sound in Okhbama.* “I am afraid, in the sanctimony of the great Sea Serpent, that these shall be my final years standing upon the throne of Valbaneea.”

“A service,” *Okhbama said, a singular word describing the Xamenli relationship to Valbaneea.* “our pride and invigoration of the victory we held. For why do you falter here?”

“I am afraid that my cousin has forced me into this position.” *replied Čarlotte.* “She told me that I was no longer suited and that her husband was to become king.”

Okhbama, in a sense of disappointment for his older peer, sternly told [[Čarlotte]] “How could you let a foreigner run your country?”

“I figured that she was correct. As I grow old, I knew I had spent most of my years battling.” *Čarlotte said, shifting his tone to a more serious manner and emboldening his stature. He sat straight like the posture of a musician. “Besides, I have a more *secretive* plan. I have set the motion for my ‘death’ to occur.”

Okhbama was befuddled, bewilderment consuming him. He had known Čarlotte for years, in fact Okhbama would consider him like an *uncle.* 

“Čarlotte,” Okhbama said in return “what the fuck are you talking about?”

**The Xamenlian Anti-Piracy Fleet**
*After War for the Conqueror’s sea, Čarlotte opposed his life and saw futile to his potential. In secret, he had travelled to Xamenlian lands to seek intellectualism and a new greatness. A grandiose plan he proclaimed, the Anti-Piracy Fleet.*

*Gathering abandoned pirate ships from the docks of Azuria and [[Mavaria]], including those that had been captured in the war for the Conqueror’s sea, Čarlotte had mostly taken them for personal usage. However, as a conflict arises Xamenlia happened to need a stronger navy. By no means was the Xamenli fleet weak, in fact they had direct control over parts of Azuria. However, they stood no match for Mavarian ships and a desperation for power had to be filled. The one to do such a thing?*

*Čarlotte gathered 200 ships, a size unknown to most, which totally dominated Xamenlian shores. He called this the Fleet of Čarlotte, or rather The Anti-Piracy Fleet which was built up in the matter of a decade passed. 

*Such ships were equipped with weaponry, large bows, some even armored. However, armored ships were less common due to how expensive they were and also due to the fact that the Piracy Fleet was a defensive one, not an aggressive one. Some criticized it as it used a lot of resources, but a general fear for pirates had elevated the need for such a navy.*

# PART 2
[[## Riveria]]

**[[City of Maris]] - Werth the Hero**
*Werth paced on the wooden plank of his chamber after he was woken by the watchmen. The balcony for which he had stood was not a safe place for Werth. He had to defend the city of Maris, the city which had withstood time history, the city that had lived his entire life.

*Crows flew in the sky, a symbol of the Valbaneeans. However, crows also signified tragedy and impending death. A sign of foreboding scared Werth, yet Werth had to become brave and defend his city.

*Perilously and precariously rushing down the stairs of his quarters, he went to the battlefield. Quickly devising a plan, he had heard rumors of certain Valbaneean war tactics.* “Wordington Terrorism,” *so they called it.

*He ordered the city garrison to regroup upon the walls and watchmen to arm themselves with their nearest spear or pike. He had readied catapults among the walls of the city, ringing bells and shouting to make noise. Surely it wouldn’t take long for Valbaneean support to arrive, the city garrison holding strong and starting to realize their reliance on the Riverian defenders. That was not the most of their concerns of course, the garrison gathering to attempt creating multiple larger units instead of divided units.

“We will not yield!” *Werth said loudly.* “We will not fall!” 

*Walls were closed and large doors were locked trying to block the onslaught of navy men. They would use boards, spears, whatever it took to block it up until Valbaneean backup appeared, whatever means possible if it meant the city would survive! 

“For that bloody Jolly Roger
To be no longer Jolly
Shall be a Rogertin https://discord.com/channels/596715011913678849/1085308100468277320/1142948860977750067”

MEANWHILE

…As a Zavar sailor charged with his weapon towards a Ngolan garrison member, a fucking wasp nest is thrown at him. He immediately runs away and retreats back to ship.

**The Camp at [[City of Dragulj]]**
*Valbaneeans and Riverians set up camp in the dense jungle, the towering trees hiding their position. Despite the regulations put in place by Čarlotte, they huddled and drank alcohol near the fire. There was camaraderie, remorse, and pride that could only be expressed with a simple drink.*

*A Xerelani soldier proclaimed a toast to Riveria, his lips scented with Jangārajan ale.* “For Riveria!” *he said in a drunken speak. Collectively, the soldiers cheered over their shared experiences with a cheeky laughter and giggle filling the air with gale. 

“Silence men!” *their superior spoke in a stern whisper.* “They will hear you from here, your spiels of alcohol are not appreciated by the serpent.” *He sighed but knew it was hard to change minds.*

“You better up now,” *the man said.* “Tonight we’re making our move.”

In exasperation, the drunken soldiers went to their quarters with haste.*

**Reclaim Riveria**
*They awoke hungover yet not forgetting of the night. Hopefully they had not been noticed as today was the time of action. As they marched, they silently chanted a hymn of Riveria and Valbaneean brotherhood.*

“Attention!” *announced the Valbaneean generals. Their uniform marching formed the heartbeat of the army. They halted, taking the precise measures to hold their feet into position. Their soles hurt and dug into the dirt holding spears to their side.*

“We will reclaim Xerelan,” *one of the generals spoke interrupting the bare silence. It felt as a long time if the army was an individual being.* “and we shall **Reclaim Riveria**”

*Some men held back taking a defensive stance at Dragulj and [[City of Vikend]], securing them with numbers and watchful eyes. 900 eyes stationed at Vikend, 800 stationed at Dragulj. Manning them would be spearmen, bowmen, and heavy infantry. The troops divided as a front force would make a push back to Riveria. 
This was part of a greater plan to corner the [[Trifarix Legion]] to Xerelan.*

**[[City of Navoria]]**
*Despite a new orientation on reclaiming Riveria, the Valbaneean numbers were forced into the [[Toro Tribes]] Jungle. Luckily, Valbaneean Jungle was not much different, if not denser than the Toro Jungle. It served minor inconvenience yet was a great struggle to transverse. They would gather into a larger group and decide to push further back into Navoria instead of further into the Toro. Toro land was a risky terrain, even if they knew how to deal with such a thing, so it was generally safer to invade Navoria instead. 

They would march back to Navoria and plot a surprise attack on them, a return was unlikely and unexpected turn as a retreat. They push into Navorria and attempt to place it into a second siege, doing so whilst forming large shield walls around it to encamp mostly with jungle tactics and untraditional weapons.

*If such a tactic were to succeed, troops were to be ordered to march toward Xerelan and push the Triafarix out.*

**City of Serpiente - Valbaneean Soil**
“Simply outrageous,” *the seasoned head general Petara spoke. He had fought in a multitude of wars yet hasn’t received such of an offense as this.* “How could Mavatas allow for this to happen?”

*Angrily, and acting upon his fruition as a Valbaneean, took manners into his own hand. Recruiting ~5,000 men (most of which were already hiding in the region if you recall) some of his former men, 3,000 Thernchik soldiers, and 2,000 Ngolan mercenaries, he formed an army to combat the Zavar and Holy Mavar at Serpiente. He hadn’t quite trusted Mavatas being a foreigner, yet played into his keys as a highly-payed general for the army. Upon gaining permission, he made an immediate stance.*

*Petara would launch an offensive, 2,500 heavy infantry wielded with superior weapons and armory of Jangarajan steel that had been sold to them during Charlotte’s rule. They believed that they could overpower their troops in close combat by keeping sturdy defense, however they needed a weapon that would better suit armory, some even opting for swords but most for crude maces. This would mean they take a defensive position with a skirmish at serpiente*
