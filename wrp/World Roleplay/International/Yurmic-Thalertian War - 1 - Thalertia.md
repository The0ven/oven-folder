[[Thernik Union]]

Thalert: 6,000 regular levies, 6,000 trained troops
The Vajravarta mercenary company: 3,000
```

**A insignificant Mercenary?**
*`Dhananjay Vajravarta arrived to Thalert and offered his services to the Ruling republican council of Thalert as a sword for hire. First the council considered him as a amateur brat but after knowing that this young man was the son of Governor Dharmanandana of the Kāverīpa-Radhiraja, they naturally had to take him seriously.`*

*The young man seemed to be here to help their efforts against the so-called military theocracy of the Yurmeich, It seemed that the Governor had sent his son in the hopes of helping Thalert and its leaders in the 're-unification' of the Thernchik polity...

_So obviously, the council accepted the services of the heir to Kāverīpa-Radhiraja and let him do the dirty work!

*`"And the young lass announced his arrival with a loud thunderbolt..."`*
*Dhananjay's mercenary company was being paid hefty gold from his father's coffers. Yet, and naturally so, the company's veteran leaders had their doubts about the young man and his ability to lead men to battle. Afterall, the Vajravarta were a house of nobles who were known for their skills and successes in stewardship rather than martial prowess...

_Dhananjay on the other hand, was quite enjoying his new adventure. 
"Such a verdant valley! I never knew the Thernchik lands down-south would be so beautiful!"

_His youthful enthusiasm was something that the people of Thernchik lacked. Those people had seen conflicts, a lot of them. They had seen their realm broken and fell into chaos and a era of disunity and disparity. 

_The soldiery of Thalert specifically lacked a leader in whom they could put their trust in. The military forces of the Republic seemed to be only fighting for the sake of earning some gold, while the rest did so they could secure their lands from the destruction of war. 

_Morale was arguably low...

_That was ofcourse, Until this young lad came from nowhere.

_`Strategy`
_The Vajravarta Company would take command of the ground operations after their arrival and subsequent hiring by the council leadership of Thalert. Knowing that the heir of the mighty house of Vajravarta had himself arrived to 'aid' Thalert was quite comforting for the plutocrats. 

_Gradually, and a bit unusually, Dhananjay started to take a leadership role within the Thalert's army himself.

`"Being led by a ragtag leadership will do you men no good! Lives are important, very important. Put your faith in my capabilities and you will live enough to see your grandchildren."`

*Dhananjay's occasional reassurance to both the levies and elites of Thalert's army was a good morale maintenance.*

`"Young man, Being optimistic and reassuring is good and all, But confidence alone is not enough to make you win war."` 

*A senior commander of Thalert's army explained and doubted the young lass's capabilities.

_Dhananjay simply nodded and smiled, He wanted to answer the old man with his plan. He decided to take a calculated and sophisticated approach towards the conflict.

*`"If we take out the center of the adversary's leadership; then the battle is won. The good thing is that there are enough resources for us to utilize and achieve this goal with limited complexity."`*
*Dhananjay explained to the commanders, the lower leadership of the army alongwith his own captains of his mercenary company. The "resources" that Dhananjay referred to was the road-system that was constructed by the previous regime, and fortunately, these roads led to the city of Yurmeich. Yurmeich was previously the capital of united Thernch and now was the center of the Holy Yurmeich Urmikdom. The plan was ambitious, simple and feasible.*

`"There is no reason for us to not use our full force to capture this city which would consequentially eliminate the adversary's will to fight."`

*Dhananjay made his point clear. Numbers must be used smartly, and that's what he was going to do. Overwhelm the enemy and take down their center.

All the important men inside the camp looked at the young man with a mix of confidence and uncertainty. Meanwhile, Dhananjay simply smirked at the commander who previously doubted his confidence.*

```For this offensive, The full force of the available manpower would be utilized by Dhananjay. His own mercenary company (3,000), alongside the available levies & regulars of Thalert (7,000) would focus on securing this entire region.```

**Defense:**
*The enemy is focusing their efforts on advancing in southern territories. Dhananjay would order reinforcements of the garrisons deployed south so they can hold their defenses, fortifications, towns or villages. Around 2,000 will reinforce this location (cyan) and regroup with the pre-existing 3,000 which would total to 5,000 in this front.*
*```Activation of the Kaveritara fleet:```*
*A navy was constructed in Pushpakaranya for the sole purpose of projecting power of the Jangarāja in the Kaveritara river valley. This naval force was constructed under a cover of secrecy and its operations were largely kept clandestine. All these boats and ships were built under the jurisdiction of the Governor. As a result, Dharmanandana owns them all. And now, it is time to fully utilize this fleet and establish superiority in the region. He will aid his son in whatever way he can.*
