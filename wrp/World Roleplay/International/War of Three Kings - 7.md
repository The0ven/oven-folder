MEANWHILE: [[A Letter and a Dagger]]

# Mavir Massacre
*The sun beats relentlessly down along the banks of the [[Mavir River]]. Sweat pours from the brow of Sunjak of Makvor. He looks out into the sun, over the river towards the northern region of the [[Holy Mavar State]] and [[Navarre]]. From his vantage point atop the wooden tower constructed in preparation for the [[Xamenlia]]n advance, Sunjak could see lines of smoke rising from the burned forests and camp fires of this new threat from the east. The largest plume rose from Zakvor, where Sunjak's forces had burned the town to avoid its second sacking in 30 years. The lieutenant knew this was a double edged sword; on one hand the [[Valbaneea]]ns would now lack the valuable supplies the city once held, but would also feel spurred on by this sign of weakness by [[Mavaria]]. He climbed down from the lookout and gathered his subordinates. The plan was clear. The river could not and would not fall.*

*As the Xamelian troops collected their camp and made their way towards the river, the Wolf was worried. He had been sent by his Valban king to oversee their new allies attack and considering everything so far, he had seen nothing but success. The initial attack had been a massive victory, and Navarre had fallen quickly afterwards. The destruction of Zakvor by the retreating armies had been a hit to supply, yes, but they had now captured Navarre and were on the edge of pushing deep into the Toro lands. Part of the Wolf hoped it would be this attack that could end the horrid war. Part of him also knew the Mavarians were not an easily defeated people. Regardless, he agreed with the Xamelian leaders that it was time to overthrow the defenders of the jungle.*

"MEN, gather your weapons! Today, we conquer the Mavir! Tomorrow, ALL OF MAVARIA! Keep your minds and blades sharp today. We will win the day, the cowardly enemy already retreats from the advance of our spear point! Gather now, we march to the river when the sun is a quarter to its highest point."

*Kevlar Tanax stepped down from the makeshift podium and heard trumpets sound, blasting the announcement to ready to the camps all along the border. Over the next few hours, the army gathered and marched to the river. The attack started with the elephants charging alongside levies, the quiet wooden ramparts along the river beckoning with their silence as a siren beckons with its song. As the troops reach the riverbed, the elephants roared and reared, some collapsing as blood sprayed from their legs. Wooden spikes jammed into the mud and hidden under brush now dripped with blood from the great grey beasts. The soldiers were cut down by arrow fire raining from the ramparts as crossbows unleash their payloads. The charge continued across the river, troops stamping through the shallow waters with shields raised. The Xamelian forces, thinking they had the advantage, realized their assumptions erroneous. The Wolf began to yell, calling for forces to retreat back over the river and defend, but Kevlar was further north, calling for his forces to do the opposite. The troops were split, thousands retreating while thousands other smashed against the wooden structures. The surviving elephants in the north proved powerful, sending the walls into an array of splinters shooting across the air.*

*The battle raged on for hours, both sides fighting tooth and nail for control of the river. Eventually, it was evident the Mavarians had gotten the upper hand. Kevlar Tanax looked around, ankle deep in the flowing river, and saw nothing but pain. His comrades felled like crops in autumn, the enemy folded over their barricades pouring blood. The river was thick, the waters stained scarlet lapped at his boots with the consistency of wine left to rot. The stench permeated everything, many soldiers had pulled their tunics over their noses but the smell clung to the fabric like a malevolent honey. Kevlar finally called for retreat, the troops forced to make camp on the other side of the river.*

*While Kevlar was resting, licking his wounds from the battle on the river, he was startled as the Wolf threw open the flap to his war tent.*

"WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING!"

*The Wolf was screaming, he was young and rarely questioned the other generals, but this was too far even for him.*

"YOU KNOW HOW MANY MEN DIED IN THAT RIVER TODAY?! GOOD MEN! OUR ALLIES! WE ASKED THEM TO JOIN US IN THE WAR AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY THEIR KINDNESS?! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!"

*Kevlar was frozen, he'd never been scolded this way, certainly not by someone younger than him. He face reddened with anger as he shouted back:*

"YOU DARE QUESTION ME BOY?! MY I WAS SLAUGHTERING THE ENEMY IN BATTLE WHILE YOU WERE STILL CRAWLING IN THE MUD!" 

*He settled, his voice calming from the fever pitch.*

"Do not come here and question my decisions. We may be equals in rank but be wary of who you make your enemy. In a time of war like this, one can never be too careful, and yet there are still often... unintended casualties..."

*He trailed off, leaving the obvious threat hanging in the air which thickened with malice. The wolf took a step back, his stomach turning in on itself and a shaky feeling crawling its way up his spine. He opened his mouth as if to speak, but closed it and turned. As he exited he let out one last remark, just barely audible to Kevlar:*

"Their blood is on your hands..."

# The River Weeps
*It was a hot summer day in [[Riveria]] and the duchy was tired. The [[Trifarix Legion]] had thinned to nearly a third of their initial size, the war taking a great toll on them as it did everyone. Efforts to raise levies had been successful, and the victory at Xerelan meant the legion finally had consistent supply back to Zavaria and the city states. [[City of Dragulj]] and [[City of Vikend]] had ended up being almost as key as the victory in Xerelan, as control of the entire coast was now firmly in the hands of the Mavir alliance. The troops knew they did not have long however. They remembered Serpiente, the advancing force that must have now recaptured the city. They had prepared a strategic defense, layered deep into Riveria to whittle away the Valbaneean force before they could reach Xerelan, but they could never have been prepared for the onslaught that was approaching.*

*Pikar of Forlan knew a tide was coming. He had lead the attack into Serpiente and now brought his force north to Sjever. The town had been heavily fortified, troops stationed along the river and around the town to ambush the advancing forces. Pikar was watching as the troops in front of him continued to dig holes. These pit traps were an early layer of defense. While their effectiveness did decline as troops would fall in, the ones closer to the city were covered with underbrush to fool additional troops. Pikar smiled, he knew the Valbaneean forces was massively outnumbering his own but seeing the massive effort to prepare brought him hope.*

*The Valbaneeans marched south, a massive army ready to retake Riveria from the Mavarians. The Jaguar marched alongside his troops, pushing towards Sjever. He hated the Mavarians, remembering stories of the times when Gaf the rapist had ruled over Valban lands. He felt proud to lead the armies, all Valban regiments fresh from Tyranno, reaching the border to Riveria and continuing down towards Sjever. That's when the march began to unravel. Soldiers fell into spike pits, arrows soared inivisbly from the dense jungle and picked off the Valbaneeans. Immediately, the marching group scattered, some following their training to take defensive positions but the immense size of the advancing army caused panic to set in throughout the ranks. The Jaguar yelled out orders, raising his shield to defend against the hidden archers. Defensive formations slowly formed, and some heavily armoured troops braved the jungle, cutting through it find and kill the archers. The ambush ended as suddenly as it started, and the march to Sjever continued.*

*Just outside of the city, the troops saw the Mavar fortifications. Logs had been strewn across the road, and thrown into the river to block traditional methods of advance. The invaders fanned out to surround the city, while staying out of range of the archers. Then they began to advance on the city from all sides. Pikar saw his opportunity and took it. Shouting the order, hundreds of arrow tips appeared from behind fortifications. Arrows rained from the sky like hellfire, descending on the Valbaneeans in a wave. Shields went up, but few were fast enough. Troops dropped like flies, then the second wave appeared overhead.*

*The Jaguar knew it was too late to retreat and instead ordered a full force advance. Troops stormed the city, shields raised to the incoming wave after wave of arrows. The archers defending Sjever were overwhelmed, and Pikar deployed his second strategy. Spear tips emerged overtop the fortifications, troops storming out from every crevice and forming into phalanx as quickly as possible. The effect was immediate, the rushing frontline was skewered. But it was not over, the Jaguar knew this. The dead bodies and phalanxes were trampled by the swelling mass of soldiers, crashing through the fortifications like a tidal wave. Their numbers were too immense and both generals knew this. The Jaguar ordered a contingent of men to cross the river and cut off any retreating troops. The logs proved a challenge, allowing Pikar and a contingent of soldiers to escape, firing the last of their arrows into the enemy, however a second wave of routing was cut off by the Valbans, who killed every man standing against them.*

# Maris Has Fallen, Millions Must Die
*Werth was worried. He heard the clashing between the pirates and his garrisons out in the street getting closer by the hour. He had hoped the sun setting would have forced the pirates to halt and rest, but it seemed to have only emboldened them. Now, rooves burned bright as the pirates set fires to light their way forwards. At least, he thought, they had allowed surrendering civilians to escape. His people were safe, the [[City of Maris]] would not be exterminated tonight. He was clad in armour now, sword in hand. He was holed up in his keep, the most defensible point in the city, with a garrison captain and a mere few hundred guardsmen who had been able to reach the inner walls in time. He was about to speak to his men when a shout from outside cut him off.*

"OH WERTHHHHHHH" 

*The voice was almost hissing, as if the serpent itself was speaking.*

"You have burrowed yourself away like a cowardly rat Werth! Do you know what we do to rats when we find them aboard our ships? Do you Werth?"

*The shouting stopped and Werth could just faintly hear a snicker, to which a symphony of deep chuckles reverberated, the pirates mocking him in unison with their leader.*

"WE"
"EXTERMINATE"
"THEM"

*Sarah's voice roared through the empty city, the crackle of fire the only other sound now.*

"If you do not surrender now, the worst is yet to come. If you come out and lay down your weapons, we promise not to kill you or your remaining pitiful guardsmen. We even have someone here who is DYING to see you."

*A cackle, evil yet saccharine, rung in Werth's ear. He cautiously tilted his head so he could just barely see out the window chiseled into the stone walls of the keep. He caught sight of her for the first time in his life. She was around his age, slightly younger he thought. He black hair cropped just above her shoulders shrouded most of her face, though he could make out a few gashes across her pale skin, still fresh from the battle. He watched as she pushed her cape across her shoulder so it lay on her back and stared up at his window. Their eyes locked instantly, and something in those silvery eyes... he couldn't help feel, she was beautiful. As quickly as their eyes met his departed, flicking to the hooded figure moving in front of her. She pulled the shroud back, revealing-god no, it couldn't be...*

*Duke Avaram peered up at the castle window, the same one through which his brother had looked down and they'd seen each other for the final time. Now, he saw his brother's face for the first time in decades, but different, younger. His nephew peered out at him, visibly shaken. Avaram tried to manage a reassuring smile, but his body was so weak it came out more a limp grimace. He collapsed to his knees. Then he heard the clattering of metal on stone. Looking up, he saw his nephew holding a hand out the window, and then following the stone down he saw Werth's blade laying flat on the stones below...*
### Casualties:
**Mavaria:** 
	1,200 Soldiers
	1,050 Pirates
	800 Archers
	400 Levies
**Maris:**
	All garrisons killed or captured

# Searching for the Lost, Xerelan
*Pikar was standing with Yuvan of [[Zavaria]] and Lord Posok the [[Toro Tribes]]. They were all hunched over the map table in their war tent, moving pieces across the board to run through the possible scenarios. A messenger entered the tent, a middle aged jungle ranger panting:*

"The enemy, they are approaching... and there is a second army..."

*Pikar clenched his jaw to stop his face going white, but saw Lord Posok had not maintained the same composure. He turned to the messenger and dismissed him, thanking him for his haste in delivering the information. The three men discussed next steps. They had still received no word from Sarah Mavarax down in Maris, and were unsure they would have anywhere to go were Xerelan to fall. The generals gathered, and whispered plans to each other. They stepped back, and nodding in agreement stepped out onto the hill where the tent was situated. Before them lay their defenses and camp. Sprawling networks of wooden blockades littered with tents and camps, campfires burning as the troops were eating lunch. Pikar turned to his comrades:*

"This battle will be brutal. Our enemies are relentless so we must be too. Our enemies are calculating so we must be too. Most of all, our enemies are willing to sacrifice everything to win, so we must be too..."

# Shadows of Tyranno
*A peasant wandered the streets of Tyranno, Valbaneea's great capital. Since the start of the war the city had felt tense. Though its citizens did not have to face the daily reality of war head on, its effects were still felt. The levity of peacetime was replaced by a cold air of dread. Especially when reports had come that the war was not progressing well and more men needed to be marched south. This peasant was dressed in common clothes, a brown tunic and heavy trousers tied with a belt of hempen rope. He walked with some urgency and a posture somewhat unusual for someone of a low class. He walked along the roads towards the keep at the center of the city, stepping from shadow to shadow as the oil lamps flickered in the night. He reached a ditch on an off side of the castle, a small trough just barely big enough for him to squeeze through. He slid his legs in first, his toes dipping against the thick liquid coating the bottom of the trench. Crouching down, he had to breathe through his mouth to try and ignore the acrid stench. His eyes watered as he took a few steps forwards, reaching ahead in the pitch darkness to find the wall to the vertical shaft before him. Finding it, he dug his finger tips into a small crease he'd chiseled into the potin months before. He found the tube familiar, having practiced this climb a number of times, always under the cover of darknes, since he'd made the holds. One hand after the other found purchase as he began to climb...*

*Mavatas was fast asleep, the hours reaching into the next day by now. Below him, the man was emerging into the staff lavatories. He stripped his clothes and dropped them back down the chute from whence he'd came and donned a staff uniform stashed underneath a few loose tiles in the floor. Donning the new uniform, the man straightened it out as he stepped into the hall. He passed a servant bringing a morning refreshment to the king, bumping her and causing it to spill slightly on her. He apologized profusely, promising to deliver the drink for her while she washed the stain. She gratefully handed him the tray, and he walked up the staircase to the grand door to the King's chambers, passing his sleeve over the cup as soon as he was out of sight. His breathing was heavy, two heavily armored guards stood on either side of the doors, their spears crossed to denote that the door was closed to any entry. He motioned to the drink, but the guards shook their heads in unison. Panicking slightly now, he breathed a sigh of relief when they motioned to a small table beside the door. He placed it there and walked back down the stairs, confident the serpent would allow his plan to succeed.*

*Over an hour later, Mavatas was sitting upright in bed, his hand on his chest. He was having trouble breathing. Beside him the queen was sobbing, and two doctors were applying the remedies they could to cure him. On the outskirts of town, two guards found a body stinking of excrement, turning him over they found his eyes bright red and puffy, his mouth devoid of saliva. Suddenly, one of the guards let out a hoarse cough. Across many lands, some men of the Mavir river garrison were gathered around, playing a traditional game to pass the time. During the rest, many wounded by spears and arrows had grown sick, and these men were among them. One soldier, a wrapping covering his shoulder where a Xamenlian arrow had struck, drew a raspy breath before entering another coughing fit. This time, he pulled his hand from his mouth and saw his blood dripping down it...*
