Dahem is a distant, Theocratic Absolute Monarchy practicing the developing Chayesk faith located at the ends of [[Selfalora]], believing in the story of the migrations of the Tsarani and Volem peoples in their unity as the chosen people, being lead on a path to the land chosen by Zah, their god, to a great, luxurious land. With their capital in Zahlu, they are isolated from practically all other Selfaloran states and their cultures, developing in a completely different path despite their relative proximity; they have little contact with foreigners, periodically interacting with the [[Csarian Empire]] and other close-ranged civilizations like [[Zalaria]] and the [[Ancaemites]]. They live in a transition between the great jungles of Selfalora and the large desert below, having great fertility in its land.
