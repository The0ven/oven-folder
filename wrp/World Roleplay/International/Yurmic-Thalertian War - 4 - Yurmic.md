*The Retreat from the South:

Though the south remains under our control, it has been deemed necessary to redeploy our forces towards the north, across the formidable Xhepaliks River. The decision has been made to consolidate our troops and reinforce our presence in strategic locations.

With the order to retreat, the soldiers remain disciplined, despite the knowledge that they must leave behind the settlements they fought so hard to protect. The journey northward is arduous, stretching over unforgiving terrains. As they march, they carry with them the hopes and aspirations of those they leave behind.

The bridging point at the Xhepaliks River assumes grave importance. It serves as the gateway to the safety of our northern territory. As our valiant troops approach the bridge, they set it ablaze. The flames consume the wooden structure, ensuring that our southward retreat remains a one-way path. The burning bridge stands as a symbol of both sacrifice and determination, severing any possibility of immediate enemy advances against our backlines.

*Pushing the Northern Stalemate:*

The protracted stalemate at the Northern front has thrust the command into a position of urgency. To break the deadlock, General Vulsk, recently promoted for his exceptional leadership, spearheads a daring offensive to swing the tide of battle in our favor.

General Vulsk's reputation precedes him as his battle-hardened troops rally under his command. The anticipation of breaking through the stalemate fuels their morale, filling the ranks with a fervent determination. Fanatics, skilled archers, and resilient foot soldiers march in unison, ready to face the enemy with unwavering resolve.*
