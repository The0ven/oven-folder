[[Bottanic Kingdom]]

**Offensive**
*Previous offensives failed but now we won't. King Banseth is hellbent on taking back all the territory and forts that have been lost to those shroomers. Now the's adversary numerical advantage is truly gone. King Banseth regroups his battle-groups and raiders alike into one military force numbered 8,000, a quarter of this force are [[Vistadorada]]'s troops.*

*Banseth marches right into the center to thwart the [[Nanacatl]] out of the sight of the eastern forts and back into the river.* 

*King Banseth is a good military leader. It wasn't unusual for him to recognize the true purpose of the Jungle prowlers' legion that came with the [[Jangaraja Empire]]'s condottiere. The Vanachari legion, as it is called in their native language, is a heavy, charge infantry.* 

*These glaive-wielding men are able to pass through the dense jungle by cutting through the vegetation with their glaives and unleash hell upon their enemies with their wide-ranged glaives. This shock infantry is a very good demoralizing and chaotic instrument on the battle. Recognizing these characteristics, King Banseth employs these legionaries under his direct command.* 

*King Banseth begins to sweep through the camps of the Nanacatl and eliminate their numbers one by one. The whole process is deliberately carried out brutally, The sentinels of Vistadorada overpower the levies recruited by the shroomer counterparts in sheer skill meanwhile the JangarƒÅjan shock infantry stirs up chaos in the enemy's ranks when unleashed during a engagement.*

"This is the festival of warriors, A festival of war!"

*The Cruel king, King Banseth proclaims. Hell awaits the Nanacatl as their morale breaks down and their numbers get slaughtered.*
