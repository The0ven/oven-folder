```Continuation:```

*After the successful landing of Dhananjay and his forces downsouth, He has earned respect & acclamation for his skills as an able warrior and commander. Dhananjay expects to fight his upcoming battle with much valor now. 

_On the contrary, There is still a lot to achieve. Or maybe not. 

_The odds are in the right place. Dhananjay regroups and reinforces his armies in villages near Háyealsk for 2 weeks before issuing his next orders: march forward. 

*The Yurmeich must be driven out of southern Thernch, They will be severely weakened to pose a threat after their eventual subjugation and annhilation. The General who goes by the name of General Komtov is currently enjoying occupation in Turrenlel, Dhananjay wants to off him first. 

*Háyealsk‐Rheourteska-Turrenlel, that's the roadmap.*

`Counter-Ambush`

***"These mosquitoes are a pain in the ass. I will squash all of them!"***

*Dhananjay refers to the constant harassment and ambushes carried out by the Yurmeich. Indeed, its a pain in the ass as it causes needless casualities. Offensives are a costly endeavour in the jungle for sure.

*But Dhananjay Vajravarta is just too good to fall into such cycles. 

*Dhananjay orders the construction of wooden carriages that would be guarded by civilian-looking men, or merchants. There is enough timber & wood to build a adequate amount of those.

*Those carvans would travel en masse utilizing the road networks & systems. Upon being spotted by a potential ambusher, the enemy would first contemplate the military nature of this caravan. Whether the enemy acts hostile or not, Soldiers would start pouring out of the caravans when they feel that the enemy is nearby. 

*Swinging their halberds and swords; the soldiers would massacre the ambushers with numerical superiority. A powerful counterjab.

*Dhananjay also recommends his soldiers to take shelter in those carvans to avoid being striked by arrows in the open. 

*Guerilla tactics have a limitation, Exhaust the enemy with superior tactics and he shall be vulnerable to be striked down.*
