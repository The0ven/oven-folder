# 1 - Mavir Blockade

> With the loss on the Mavir front and retreat from our northern troops, we will make multiple  blockaded on the thin Part of the [[Mavir river]], either by Dams made out of wood or just filling the driver with heavy debris 

> Our Goals are to make their river fleet pause, giving an opening for our archers and pirate crossbowmen to rain down with fire arrows 

> if their ground troops try to attack our archers, then they will push back into the jungles and our jungle rangers and pirates with shields will do Human Kebab tactics by trapping them from north and south side, closing in in it and making them clustered in small space, troops would be stationed at both sides of the River.

- __4,180 Jungle Rangers, 4,750 pirates, 2k levies__
# 2 - Toroland blockade

 > The troops from [[Toro Tribes]] were sadly too slow to come to the aid of city state but now will put up the blockade where Jungle Rangers will perform multiple Blitz's attacks during the day and night Riverian and [[Valbaneea]]s forces and those who retreated from Siege of [[City of Navoria]]. Their experience with the main road should help them at preparing the surprise attacks on the enemy forces. 

- __5k Jungle Rangers, 3k pirates, 400 levies from Tori who survived and 3k levies from Toroland__
# 3 - Navoria Supply chain

 > The city should be used to resupply the upcoming Northern Camping along [[Maris River]] but the first pair of supplies will go to the surviving locals of the city.  Prince Kurlon and his Legionaries would act as Northern blockade at [[Riveria]]n and Valbaneeas troops in the South.

- __3.1k Legionaries, any possible levies from Navoria raised to serve again, and Crown Prince Kurlon__
# 4 - Riverian Blockade

 > Around 100 Legionaries would be stationed at Sjever and 250 in Xeralan where they will raise levies by promising them food and arming them with weapons and armour they got ahold of after defeating the enemies.  The "Old Man" should be taken prisoner and sent towards the [[City of Maris]] for future plans.

> The surviving [[Vistadorada]]ns and other Legionaries should act as Western Blockade on the enemy troops in the fallen City states, their goal is to blockade the many roads.  

> as there is no threat of Maris's Navy, the [[Zavaria]]n part of the navy will pull back and go towards [[City of Vikend]] where they will land and try to take back both cities from the enemy. 

- __370 Vistadoradans, 1550 Legionaries, 75 Mavar Ships = 75 Mavar Battleships, 2,375 Sailor Soldiers, 1,375 Sailor Archers, 2,375  Levy Sailor Soldiers and Captain Xavier__
# 5 - Serpiente Hell

> The Legionaries stationed in the Valbaneea town will make it into their bunker, by digging traps around the city northern side and flanks, by blocking few streets so the enemy who charge in end up in tight spaces in which the Legionaries are trained in, and also block the river with debris.

> if they fail to hold the city they should retreat to either Navoria or Sjever, depending on where the enemy armies will march.

- __3k Legionaries__
#  6 - Siege of Maris

> with the Pirates inside the city, it is time to wreak havoc, One part of the pirates was Ordered by [[Karlo Mavarax]] to fight off the City Garrison and scare off the civilians on the streets so the city streets would slow down City defenders from properly coordinating their defence.

> Another part of the pirates would be led by Sarah Mavarax herself, who will climb the city walls and take out the archers posted there, Sarah plans to open the gates from inside to let in the Zavar forces in the same time the Zavar armies outside the city will put down their makeshift bridge, and try to break the gates with um.. you know that big log with sharp end that is seen it the movies when breaking down doors?  Well anyway both sides mission is to open the gates 

> And third, a section of most experienced Pirates (around 30 of them) will try to sneak inside Werth II.'s palace and capture him so he can order his garrison to surrender

- __3.5k pirates, 83 Pirate ships, 118 Mavar Jugs, 2,880 soldiers, 2k archers, 1.1k Levies, Sarah Mavarax, Karlo Mavarax and General Yuvan__
# 7 - Raising Armies

> Gavran ordered more troops to help in the war effort so [[Trifarix Legion]] wouldn't be the only thing they sent. [[Holy Mavar State]]

> 9k will be raised in the capital Serpentis where 4.5k will go towards the City State Front immediately while 4.5k will stay and be trained in proper combat to be ready for the war before they are sent.

> 1k Will be raised in the city of Forlan and will be trained in combat just like in the capital and will be sent into the war later
