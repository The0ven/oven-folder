_Aurelius, recognizing the Northern Forts as the weakest link in [[Nanacatl]]'s fortifications shas decided to end long occupation of forts in north  
Upon arriving at the city,s Woldog the Prince wisely chose to camp near the southern side of the city. This decision allowed him to focus his efforts on the percesived weaker point, the Northern Forts. Knowing that building siege camps would be a daunting task given the nature of Norhern fortifications, Aurelius ordered the construction of deceptive camps. These mounds were made to appear hastily built, designed to mislead the enemy into believing the siege couldn't progress as intended one day during the siege Woldog initiated a calculated movs he weakened one front of the siege on purpose this was a strategic ruse to trick the enemy into thinking they had found a vulnerable point in the siege Woldog aimed to lure the enemy troops out of the safety of their city. He relied on their perception of weakness in the weakened front as bait. His goal was to make them believe that the besielging forces had been stretched thin knowing that at night, the enemy defenders might perceive an advantage with fewer troops in the weakened area, Woldog prepared for a nighttime engagement. While the enemy would advance towards the supposedly eposed front, Woldog would conceale his elite axe-bearing guards nearby. These highly trained troops remained hidden in the shadows with Shield-Bearing Soldiers, ready to activate trap. With the enemy now far from the safety of their city walls, woldog would initiate the plan. His shield-bearing guards and axe-bearing guards would launch am ambush they would close in on the unsuspecting enemy troops, cutting off escape routes and encircling them from all sides.![[Pasted image 20231031222447.png]]
