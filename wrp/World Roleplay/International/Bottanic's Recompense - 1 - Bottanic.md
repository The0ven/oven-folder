**A reckless adversary.** *"They...are bringing their armies, into the jungles, into our sacred forests. My High Chief-" "Bahhh, I knew this was going to happen! I may be a crude individual but I am not a fool. I shall enjoy gazing at the dead bodies of those 'shroomer' pests" Heartily spoke the King, Var Kar Banseth I, also known as, "the Cruel"

The Raiders of the Jungle and their warfare tactics: **_Either Israel IV has no idea of warfare or he is infact an insane ruler as the rumors portray him to be. Jungle terrain can be treacherous for invading armies, Especially a force this large as our scouts report it to be._**

**_It does not matter what expertise the adversary possesses, the Jungle does not make an exception for anyone. We are of warrior-blood, Our men are born to fight and Our children play with axes instead of toys._**


`MAN THE FORTIFICATIONS:`

_They were built to be our first and only line of defense. Their primary aim was to fend off a invasion in the first place. But if the commanders' intuitions are correct, the enemies's demented numerical superiority will inevitably overwhelm the defenses._ (**Note for the logger:** Its a bit annoying since the other roleplayer is treating this as modern warfare.) 

_But manning those forts that we so eagerly built is still crucial. Large or not, the enemy's army will be halted and forced to siege. This presents an opportunity that the Cruel Chief, Var-Kar plans to grab._

`GUERILLA WARFARE AT ITS FINEST:`

_Banseth's Kingdom houses no major river that flows through the heartlands. The jungle heartlands, that is. This is a geographic detail that must be taken into account. It deprives the enemy of a means to transport their armies with ease in our forests._

_Further, the extremely dense nature of [[Bottanic Kingdom]] vegetation allows the full utilization of jungle warfare._

_"You have stepped into the gates of hell, Poor men" King Banseth prepares small contingents of ambush forces. These ambush forces are equipped with iron-axes, swords forged from a unique type of steel known as the "Ayaskara-steel" imported from a vast realm in the north ([[Jangaraja Empire]]). And most importantly, spears._

_The adversary's army will have to settle down for a siege and will inevitably build tents & camps. This is the time when King Banseth will unleash hell upon those "shroomers". The raider blood that flows through our veins would be reflected in the darkness of the night, As ambushers attack and disrupt their supplies. Soldiers will be slaughtered without mercy and their tents will be burned. These attacks will occur in waves. Each night will be followed by three or four waves of ambush._

_Little time will be given for the enemy's army to relax. This is true psychological warfare only possible in our unique case._

`SABOTAGE`

_The adversary has also brought out war elephents, Too bad we will have to thrust some spears in the legs of these poor creatures. Immobilized elephents are simply of no use._

_Ambushers will also burn whatever food this army has brought with itself. The enemy will not die at the hilt of our blades but through starvation. This is a very calculated tactic, King Banseth strictly orders his ambushers to target supplies and food depots._

_These sabotage operations will cause disruption in the supply chain and chaos in the adversary's levies, Lack of food overwhelms the will to fight and this will be very advantageous in a prolonged conflict where attrition can lead to decisive results._

_"Poor bastards, I've rather have you all be impaled than see you starve like this!" â€” King Var-Kar Banseth "the Cruel"_

`HIT-N-RUN`

_Although a part of the ambush attacks, This is an old and effective tactic which we excel in. The jungle is a natural enabler of this technique and King Banseth hopes to utilize it to the fullest by:_

- _Deliberately making the enemy chase the ambushers. The ambush unit would then lead our invaders into areas with swamps, quicksand, or dense undergrowth, where they can become disoriented, slowed down, or as King Banseth claims it, "trapped"._
- _As King Banseth likes it: Coating the arrows in poison and other rotten substances such as the blood of a rotten animal carcass, and then shooting those arrows on the enemy's soldiers could result in some really gruesome events. Including widespread diseases in the enemy camp and mass-deaths._

**Conclusion:** King Banseth's strategy here is to employ guerilla, hit-n-run, ambush and sabotage tactics to exhaust the enemy's army and give them a "living hell" as an act of vengeance for even thinking of invading the High-Chief's realm. The fortifications will eventually be overwhelmed(or maybe not?), but until that happens, the enemy would be thrown into absolute chaos.
**Numbers:** 14,000 men
