## Result:
# Smoke on the Water

_Dark plumes rise of the eastern river as the Nanactl forces arrive to survey the damage. Picking through corpses, rubble, and still burning pyres bodies are piled into carts to be buried. The governor of the region holds his breath as he walks through the third charred town of the day, still not used to the smell of braised flesh that hangs over the entire river basin. His head hung in shame, he returns to his quarters to discuss the devastation the raids have brought to the villages and discuss with the generals of Nanacatl what must be done now..._

_Three hours east, a young man shuffles forwards, flanked to his front and back by other Nanacatl people, some his neighbors, other strangers. He stares at his feet, not daring to raise his eyes to meet those of the soldiers marching on either side of the chain. He gulps, unsure of what awaits him at the groups destination, or how far they must continue to walk..._

_Even further east, King Var Kar sits atop his throne, looking down at the warriors kneeling before him. Between them lies a large chest, one overflowing with riches; plundered religious symbols, gold coins, metal fixtures ripped straight from the walls of buildings. The King smiles:_ 
"You have done well my warriors, I hear this is just one of many troves of wealth you have. I praise your prowess and dedication to Bottanic. Rest now, for we must soon ride again to continue this success!! 

**Casualties:** Bottanic: 800 raiders Nanactl: Major civilian losses, small local garrison forces in towns
