``A prayer to C≈çatl commences the Earth Serpent who guards the forests and soil blessing must be received for this offensive.``

*With the recent victory, our traction must not stop, instead accelerated. With the Northern Peninsula being taken, their forts are to be studied, assumed to be identical to eachother (obviously barring some exceptions such as local geography, etc). The captured soldiers of these forts are also slated to be converted and interrogated by our Shamanic Guard, experienced priests ordained by the 'Order of the Blue [[Nanacatl]]', they are to obtain knowledge of the communication routes, methods, and help our linguists learn the language of the Battanic People for help in diplomacy on a local and grander level.*

Once the forts in the northern peninsula are studied, certain forts are to be deconstructed and scavenged for materials that can help in the war effort (circled in magenta/purple). Meanwhile, the forts that aren't slated for deconstruction are to be repaired and reinforced, as they are to act as the Headquarters, communication/logistic hubs for the main army. Meanwhile, in the deep-south, encampments are to be made, as the army is split with General Yaocoh (marked by reddish dots). These encampments are to begin building semi-permanent bridges and maintain control over the area.

Once these encampments are made, and the forts are deconstructed Israel IV is to begin the offensive.

The Northern front and deep-south fronts are to be split down the middle, with around 9k up north, and 7k in the deep-south, these are traditional army men (Not Shamanic Guard), although in reality around 7,000 will fight in the north, and 5k in the deep-south. Those who don't fight will protect the encampments.

Israel and General Yaocoh will cycle attack the forts, harassing the enemy and attempting to cut off any communication between the forts, making open field by burning the jungle near the forts to make visibility easier. Captured Battanic Soldiers are to be enslaved and forced to cut down wood for the construction of canopy striders, ensuring that their construction isn't hampered shamanic guard will escort the master engineers and builders. 

Once the Canopy Striders are constructed, due to their light-weight, small frame, and manueverability, around 3 at the minimum are to be assigned to each fort, although the canopy striders lack power, the stone walls should stand no chance with sustained pressure. 
Note: ``The Canopy Striders are to launch balls of slain Battanic Soldiers into fortification walls. Mainly to demoralize but also to spread illness.``

While the main offensives are happening, detachments of mainly decentralized 'guerrila' orientated Shamanic Guard are to attack the centre, numbering around 1,000 they are supported by a detachment of 900 exceptional traditional men-at-arms. They will attempt to finally end the sieges in the centre, quickly, with the shamanic guard using their exceptional hand-hand combat, and psychological warfare
