## ELABORATION: 
Strict training of selection of soldiers program began a while ago (when I started RP lmao) 

## TACTICS: 
The first tactic is to engage with early naval battle with [[Zavaria]] seeing as they are probably prepared, establishing an anti-piracy fleet. 20 warships will attack (5 per arrow) and 40 jugs (large merchant ships) will accompany them to bring soldiers. An attempt at naval bombardment and battles at Zavar towns would be attempted Sending soldiers to [[City of Dragulj]] the trainer Troops would make a very straightforward attack hoping for little resistance as it would take a long time before Toro reinforcements could arrive. The areas are relatively small and the best military they have would be city guards-however, this is actually a test of their capabilities. 800 troops in [[City of Navoria]] would be combatted by 1,000 regular troops and a small amount of heavy infantry using [[Jangaraja Empire]] steel. It would not be quite an assault like Dragulj as the attacks would be focused upon hitting and running from enemy forces as the jungle is dense and hard to control. Scattered attacks would attempt to attack from multiple sidesâ€¦ 2000 troops are sent south using the river for navigation. 1,250 troops sent toward Navarre using pre-established roads and routes used by Valbaneea (refer to pirate war) and as it is less dense. Meanwhile, a secondary force would scout the very dense toro jungle (I believe my jungle would be denser since it is the deep jungle but I digress!!) of former expeditionary force members and soldiers and try to pick off soldiers. They would also do things like set up traps and attempt using a crude guerrilla defense
