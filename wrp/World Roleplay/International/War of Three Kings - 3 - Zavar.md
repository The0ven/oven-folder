- **Southern Battle**
Maybe outnumbered but tactically better positioned. Since the battle was in full swing, Chieftain Kuk Karakaki orders spearmen to back away while around 600 pirates stay and fight to buy time for Jungle Rangers to align their spears with retreating 1000 pirates who had shields. They would flank the northern side, form a line on the south and push through the jungle. With that, Lines of Shields will push forward, with spears sticking through the shields. This would push Valbaneeans into small clustered space, being unable to attack as there is no space to move. In any spear breaks, another spearman will take his place while the soldiers without the spear would take a weapon from the dead Valbaneean they walk over as they push them towards the riverside.

- **Northern Retreat**
Instead of trying to flank and pierce through the enemy, the troops decided to retreat into the thick jungle, which goes in favour of light Jungle Rangers and their spears, alongside help of pirates who can slay any soldiers who manage to break the spearline. The Would retreated to a tighter riverside where the jungle is closer to the river. There the spearmen while make a line (even few in the jungle section) Forcing the Valbaneeans to try to break that small gap, while that is happening, around 400 pirates will use their crossbows and shoot anyone who tries to escape the southern massacre by the river crossing
