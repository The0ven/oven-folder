[[War of Three Kings - 1 - Zavar]]
[[War of Three Kings - 1 - Valbaneea]]

## Result:
#### 1. Western Seas - Zavarian Naval Victory
The massive [[Zavaria]]n fleet completely overwhelms the [[Valbaneea]]n complement midway between the [[City of Vikend]] and the [[City of Maris]]. The Valbeenan warships see the massive armada approaching them and signal for the jugs to retreat to harbor. Unfortunately, the warships themselves are unable to route fast enough. The Valbaneean fleet was attacked with a force they had never before met and faced utter destruction. The only upside for the Valbaneeans was that the majority of jugs did manage to reach the Maris harbor before the Zavarians. The ensuing battle for Maris began as the anti-piracy fleet emerged from the harbor to engage the Zavarians. Both sides sunk some ships and three attempted boardings of Valbaneean ships were thwarted. The Zavarians found themselves unable to land properly against the combined might of the land armies and remaining naval forces of Valbaneea, leading to a stalemate where no siege was enforced but no naval force could leave the safety of the Maris harbor.
**Valbaneean Casualties:** 32 Valbaneean Warships, 6 Valbaneean Jugs
**Zavarian Casualties:** 25 Zavarian Warships, 2 Transport Ships, 180 Boarding Crew (Zavar)

#### 2. [[Mavir River]] - A Skirmish Brews!
Both the Zavarian and Valbaneean forces advance along the Mavir river, concentrating on pushing the other back. The Valbaneeans see the Zavarians coming and, noticing they are outnumbered, retreat slightly to rejoin with the troops stationed to defend. As the Zavarians continue to advance, they come to a river pass where the density of jungle on either side forces them to make a crossing. On the other side of the river waiting for them is the Valbaneean army, now having the numbers advantage themselves. Both commanders must now plan their next moves carefully, as both forces are too large to cross all at once...

#### 3. Riverian Front - Exchanging Blows
A hotly contested region, the [[Riveria]]n front provides bounty to both sides. The northern defenses were improperly prepared to defend against such a large force from the [[City of Dragulj]] and the traitorous [[City of Navoria]]. The [[Trifarix Legion]] therefore are barely resisted against during their initial advance towards [[Xeralan]], but meet resistance from an army group dispatched to the southern city states at the river's approach. The Valbaneean force is much smaller, however the RIverian and Valbaneean defenders are on their way to join the battle so the Valbaneeans must only hold off the Trifarix for so long... South of the Trifarix advance, Valbaneean and Riverian troops march together against Vikend. Their force is smaller in number yet still is able to advance well into the smaller city states as the larger force from the Zavar is distracted in the north. The Navorians dispatch a contingent to sabotage the Valbaneean routes into Riviera but are met by a larger force advancing towards them, a battle ensues where many Navorians are slain but a large portion manage to retreat south and get word to the Trifarix legion, despite taking further casualties as the Valbaneeans continue to advance into Navoria.
**Valbaneean Casualties:** 1200 Riverian Defenders, 160 Riverian Attackers, 220 Valbaneean Attackers, 120 Valbaneean Defenders
**Zavarian Casualties:** 1100 Legionnaires, 120 Dragulj, 230 Vikend, 640 Navorians
