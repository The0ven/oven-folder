A rapidly growing power in southern [[Selfalora]]. Iberian/Aztec inspired nation called the Vistadorada Sentineldom a Monoethnic country of the Doradan people with its people being unifed under Chieftain Valerio 'El Visionario' Amaranto 610 years ago. Vistadoradan culture is based around the Eternaflora Tree situated in the jungles just north of Torre Auora where it seems to have supernatural properties and has been worshiped for as long as people have inhabited these lands. The Capital of Vistadorada is on Auora Mountain with it being called Auorapico where Vistadoradas current ruler Lord Sovereign Manuel 'Del Mar Nocturno' Amaranto II currently sits the Phoenix's Throne with the Doradan people follow the religion of the Cedro Celestial (Celestial Cedar). 

Until recently ever since unification under Chief Valerio, Vistadorada had been in a prosperous isolation as to protect its people and more importantly the Eternaflora Tree from forces which would want to see it destroyed however that ended in recent decades with our current ruler having a vision that there were other Etneraflora Trees out there that need protecting and as such Vistadorada opened up its borders and now sets out to find all other trees like the Eternaflora. A religious military order known as the Sentinels of the Eternaflora also have signifcant influence over Vistadorada as they dedicate their lives to preserving the Eternaflora and combating those who would want to harm it and Vistadorada however its important to note they are a seperate organisation from the Grand Army of Vistadorada commanded by the Lord Sovereign. Vistadorada borders one nation with that being Bottanic and has alliences with [[Bottanic Kingdom]], [[Jangaraja Empire]] and [[Zavaria]].
