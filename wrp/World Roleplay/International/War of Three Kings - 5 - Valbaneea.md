_**Maris and her Fleet**_ _Maris had become a trading power in her time, an opportune area for those to dock with her graceful history. However, as conflict rose in the Conqueror’s Ocean piracy held a barrier between [[City of Maris]] and the world East. After the War for the Conqueror’s Sea, Maris had secured a seemingly impossible victory agains the [[Navarre]] pirates. Since the moment of the war, Maris had created a direct anti-piracy fleet gathered of former Navarrian ships and the Riverian Navy. It was a formidable force; however, stood no march against the navies of Zavar or the [[Holy Mavar State]]. Hearing of an invasion by [[Zavaria]], Maris had immediately send boats to busy and occupy the Zavar as they had prepared. Calling upon 500 [[Riveria]]n Soldiers, 1,000 [[Valbaneea]]n soldiers, 2,000 [[Thernik Union]] (leased) Soldiers, and 1,000 of their own citizens, Maris had established a garrison to defend the city as her navy fought. The garrison would be equipped with the finest [[Jangaraja Empire]]'s steel as Maris could pay for such a military alongside large ships to defend and watch her shores. Maris attempts to install a large naval base alongside a watchtower of her walls, men who would signal if ships were at the dock. Often to defend herself, Maris would have to raid ships in an aggressive manner, although she herself was not fit for naval battles quite yet. In a sort of symbolic relationship, Riverian and Maris’ warships and galleys (jugs) would patrol the areas watching the sea as the watchtowers watched them. Warships oftentimes held great weapons to attack, ram, or withstand attacks. Copying the design of [[Karlo Mavarax]]’s ship (a large jug modified to be weaponized,) some even larger warships are created._
