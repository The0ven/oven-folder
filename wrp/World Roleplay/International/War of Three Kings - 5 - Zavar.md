# Warmove 1
 > 95 Pirate ships that were at stand by have been called to aid the siege, that includes 7.5k pirates ready to help with the siege the city and sink if any surviving [[City of Maris]] ships tries to break true their seaside siege, half of those pirates alongside [[Zavaria]]n landing army (3k infantry, 2k archers and 2k levies) will land and surround the city. They will do a few smaller attacks after which they will send an ultimatum to surrender and they will be spared but must hand out their weapons to Zavarians and pirates, if they dont agree, they will face starvation as city has 73k people to feed
# Warmove 2
> 1.5k soldiers from [[Vistadorada]] finally land in [[Mavaria]]. They will march towards Xerelan and attack it (will explain further below)
# Warmove 3
> Since there are 12k legionaries, they will attack Sjever town, and after they successfully take it as it lacks needed defenders, the legion will split into 2 divisions of 6k. Northern division will march towards the town of Serpiente where they will attack and from an outpost, from which 3k will go south to flank the enemy who are sieging [[City of Navoria]] while other 3k will stay and hold the city . > The southern division will split also with 400 troops to stay in the city, 3k will march south at Xeralan while 2.6k will go to Navoriaâ€™s aid.
# Warmove 4
> Since this bold move from the [[Valbaneea]]n and [[Riveria]]n attackers wasn't much expected, it will take time for 3k Pirates and 2k jungle rangers to arrive to the cities aid, but Levy army of 1.5k was raised from town of Tori, who are closer to the city of Vikend and will help the city by buying the time for professional troops to arrive from [[Toro Tribes]] via jungle road network.
# Warmove 5
> Since there was quite enough reserves in Wingaria which were not sent north up the river Mavir, 3k jungle rangers will go North to aid Navoria which leave Torland region with 2k Jungle Rangers and 3k Pirates awaiting their orders (probably to go north up the river Mavir but im not sending them just yet)
