# Result: 
## Northern Battle
As the southern battle rages on, the Valbaneean forces slowly being whittled away by the Zavarians, those Valbaneeans who retreated across the river attempt to escape the crossbow's rain north towards the main Valbaneean force. As they move up they encounter the remaining Zavarian troops and engage with them. The main Valbaneean force also engages on the forest troops from the north side as they attempt to cross the river. Sandwiched between the two forces, the Zavar attempt to return to the trees but are met by the rapidly advancing central Valbaneean force. Surrounded as the Valbaneeans are in the south, the Zavar forces begin to move across the river to escape. 

## A Sudden Arrival
As the Zavar forces cross west to aid their southern cohort and escape the Valban pincer, the drum of oars in the river rises to a crescendo. **Suddenly, BAM the first boat's bow hits the log bridge, sending splinters everywhere as it smashes through.** The ships meet the crossing troops as they attempt to scatter and avoid being hit, one group of ships veering left to beach on the eastern bank while the other carries on slightly, banking right to the right an beaching directly behind the cornered Valbaneeans.
The carnage in the river is immense, Zavarian troops crushed under the ships and drowned, or slaughtered as the reinforcements hop from the boats to the river bank. The army to the north is all but defeated, the last remnants forced to retreat along with the southern crossbows far into the jungle. In the south the battle is much fiercer, but ultimately the reinforcement's positioning gives them the upper hand and allows them to break the phalanx, relieving the pressure from the encircled troops. The broken line is now outnumbered and while they try to reform the Zavar defenses collapse and retreat into the jungle to minimize losses, seeing the north lost as well.
