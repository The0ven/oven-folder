Karlo Mavarax is 8th descended of Daren Mavarax, but he unlike his ancestor, he doesn't dream of the throne, but of the freedom, riches and some land for his pirates to live on without taxes, a Pirate Haven, which is why he sailed west when he heard that Mavaria split, a perfect opportunity to take some land, which he did by killing Robert Forlandi and taking [[Navarre]] Region, but his fleet was defeated by Werth of Maris so he had to sail back to Valtirâ€¦plotting his Revenge on [[Valbaneea]], [[City of Maris]] and anyone related to Werth. Fun Fact: He has brown hair which to a Mavarax would be disgraceful as Mavarax are of Mavar blood, which means Silver Blue hair.
