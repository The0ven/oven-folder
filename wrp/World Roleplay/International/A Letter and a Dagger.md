**”My son is dead..”** The King spoke, his voice low but stoic, but a bit of sadness lingered in the air around the man. **”Are you alright, my king?”** Asked the High Marshall of the city guard, standing a few steps behind the king, who didn't reply, but stared deeply into a family portrait, drawn 3 years ago (513 ASL).

**”Who reported these..news?”** Kurlon questioned somberly, but did not move an inch, as his gaze was focused on the specific part of the portrait. The High Marshall shared his gaze and saw that he was looking at the picture of his son, who stood proudly behind the chair in which the Queen sat in, next to him was his newly married Princess Luna, whom he married 3 weeks before the portrait was drawn. 

But he didn't had time to get lost in his thoughts, he had to reply, **”It was a fresh member of Jungle Rangers by name of Qurek, my King”** The King lowered his head, nodding at the statement. **”Is he here in the city?”**, **”He is, you want me to call him in, my King?”** THe High Marshall quizzes as he picks up his spears which he a few minutes ago put alongside the wall. 

**”Yes, please do”** The King answered, and with it The Marshall left the Kings Quarters, while the King gave a last look at the portrait before walking out of his private chambers, with rays of light slowly moving away from the king's face, and going down at the King who sat in a chair next to his queen. 

—
Qurek’s footsteps echoed through the halls of the Blackiron Palace, the look of the interior fascinated and made Qurek at unease, which was funny as he ran through the deepest parts of the Faralan Jungles, but there was something eerie about the place he found himself, something he never felt while stopping to camp for awhile below a tree and surrounded by darkness as tree canopies blocked the light from reaching the ground. 

The Interior itself was decorated, in black wool and the walls were painted grey or black to fit with the silver artwork of the Serpent who’s long body decorated the walls, next to him was the High Marshall whom he followed.  **”You looked spooked.”** Qurek quickly turned his attention to the man next to him, getting aware of his surroundings, **”Uhm..yeah”** He replied quietly, his tone having a tip of uneasiness heard through.

**”First time in Hardkoor?”** Marshall quizzes the young messenger, who nodded in agreement. **”I admit i felt the same shivers when i first entered the Palace, quite eerie as it is mostly dark even during the day, but you get accustomed to its dark warmth overtime”**, Qurek didn't reply but acknowledged the Marshall’s statement, and carried on through the corridors. 

They soon made way to the final turn, which led them towards the massive wooden gates with iron outline, two serpents carved into each side of the door, the Zavar interpretation of the Serpent that is, as many Noble houses have their own versions. The smell of burned charcoal could be sensed in the air, coming from torches which rested on each side of the walls.
The Marshall and Qurek stopped near the gates, Qurek letting Marshall pull the heavy doors slightly but enough for them to pass through. Qurek was faced with a few steps in front of him, which led towards the famous Serpent Throne, behind which a huge Zavar banner was hanging, while the King himself stood next to the throne. The young Tokakian walked up the stone steps, each one echoing off the walls of the throne room. 

**”It’s great honour to be in your presence, my King”** He first bowed before kneeling on his left leg, showing his utmost respect, which The King took with the highest of approvals. **”I heard from the Marshall that you were the messenger who ran from Navoria to Sjever to Xerealan just under full moons?”** The King questioned, his tone deep but harsh because of his old age.

**”Indeed that was me, my KIng”** The young fella answered, looking up to meet the king's gaze while he was on his one knee. **”An achievement that none in history could rival, and also brought us the victory on the Riverian front, such achievement must be awarded suitably”** The King stated, but there was a sense that he paused **”But I must ask you, were you present when my son fell?”** 

The Kurlon’s tone turned sombre, Qurek could swear he heard a sense of weakness in his voice, for a man with such a strong reputation. **”Y-yes I was, my King”** Qurek replied, the memory of him hiding behind the door creeped into his mind. **”The Prince, few of Pythons soldiers and I were in a building”** Qurek, not wanting to embarrass himself, knew he had to lie. **”We fought the Valbaneeans what felt like hours, we slain many but soon only me and the Prince remained, and I got disarmed”**
Young Tokakian continued, adding a pinch of a lie into the truth, a perfect recipe he learned from his great grandmother. For now the King and the Marshall listened closely, **”I thought I was gonna get killed as soon as I fell on the ground, but The Prince blocked the blade which was going towards me, as he entered a fight against 3 enemies…He took the first two enemies swiftly but the third managed to stab him in the back with the spear.”**

Kurlon’s face tightened as he closed his eyes at the mention of the last sentence, something he trained his son to always anticipate attacks from the back, just another reminder that life is cruel. **”He turned around and killed the last enemy, then fell on the floor bleeding, I quickly went to his side, were he handed me the scroll and the rings”** He finished, then stood up and took out two rings out of his pocket.

Seeing this, The Marshall approached the Ranger, taking the rings into his hands, recognising them as the Royal ring of a Serpent Prince and a ring of Aramanto, represented by carving of a snake and a tree respectfully. The Marshall then went to the King’s side, where the King took the rigs with his old pale hands. **”You retrieved the rings, which the Royal Family is very grateful for”** The King told the young Ranger. 

The Ranger observed the King, who kept his strong demeanour but in his old age, the King was unable to hide his mourning aurora. **”Only thing we now aren't able to do is to retrieve his body, as any noble deserves a proper Mavar farewell ritual..”** The KIng added, handing the rings to the Marshall who took them and went to put them into a safe box.
**”If I may ask, what will be my reward?”** Qurek questioned, The King slowly started to approached him, **”We wanted to reward you now, but after hearing of your accomplishment, I ask last favour from you to do for Mavar Realm”** Soon, Qurek turned his head to the side, seeing Marshall return with another scroll and a dagger encased inside its holster. **”Your task is to take this scroll Karlo Mavarax who is currently sieging Maris with his pirates, and then take it to Twinia”**

**”Twinia, my King?”**, Qurek lightly gasped **”To the Yavax Family?”** He added, while gazing at the scroll, which was sealed with the Zavar stamp, sealing the secret the scroll hides. **”Then what is dagger for?”** He asked as he focused on the dagger in the Marshalls hands. **”Do you recognize it, ranger?”** Marshall asked. Qurek eyed the dagger which Marshall unsheathed out of the holster, it did look familiar to him but couldn't figure it out.

**”It belonged to the Navor of Wingaria, i thought you would guess as you are from Wingaria but i Guess histories lost artefacts aren't for everyone to learn.”** King explained as he took it into his hand, slowly waving it around as light reflected from its fine edge. **”Navor used it to kill the Zedar The Unworthy”** Qurek explained, showing that he at least knew some history of the greatest man in history of Toro Tribes, the great Liberator, First Eyes of the Serpent, established rule of 3 in an already bygone era.
**”Correct, young man”** The King spoke, putting the dagger back into the holster and handing it to the Ranger. **”You will hand the dagger over to Duchess Harla or her heir Lena, alongside the scroll”** the king put his hand onto Qurek’s shoulder. **”Complete this task, return her and you will be rewarded, now go my trusted messenger”**

Qurek knelt for the last time and started to leave the throne room, first thing he is going to do is to ready supplies and in an hour he will embark on his journey, which now left the old King and his cityguard Marshall alone. **”Before i leave my king, I have last thing to go over”** Marshall explained, peaking the King's curiosity. **”What is it?”**, **”a man who claims to be a part of Marel’s crew managed to return to our shores, saying that started a colony in a far away land, but did not decided to report back because of dangerous deep ocean”**,  **”ABSURD!”** The King yelled. **”That man just won't die!”** 

The King coughed a few times before speaking again. **”Did the word spread about this sudden revelation, does Serpant know?”**, ”**No, my king”** The King exhaled, his frustration leaving his body. **”Good, it took me too much to get rid of him and manipulate The Serpant, I say to remove the survivor quietly”** . The Marshall nodded at his order, and left the room, now the King was now alone in his throne room, he shared a gaze back at the throne, a thought of knowing his son won't be sitting on it after his passing, but that was to expected, he raised him as a warrior, a leader, not a king who plays politics all day but leads the nation on the battlefronts.. Now all there is left for him is to write a letter to Princess Luna and his grandchildren about Crown Prince Kartlun’s passing…

_”Great Duchess of [[Twinia]], doesn't matter if it's Harla or Lena Yavax, this letter i'm writing to you because of the recent turn of events. My son is dead, fighting inside the [[City of Navoria]], buying rest of his troops time to escape, he and his 300 slain many of enemy attackers before they were overrun. My son always wanted to fight the false King Mavatas of [[Valbaneea]] one on one, but that idea quickly vanished when cowardly Mavatas decided to send his troops into war while he remained in Tyranno, writing letters to all those who want to take down and take opportunity on weakened [[Mavaria]], a power hungry man who wants to retake the throne of [[Empire of The Horocians]], which he might do if he wins this war, endangering [[Jangaraja Empire]] and Twinia. Mavar Realm lost its crown prince for a city, a price which can’t be undone, so i'm sending you this deal and a dagger, Navor’s dagger, which Navor used to stab Zedar the Unworthy, now I plan to give you city of Maris if you send your best “shadow” and slay the false King Mavatas. A city for a life, a deal which may look unbalanced on my side, but it's worth more than you know. Yours, King Kurlon Zavar of [[Zavaria]] and Mavar Realm”_
