# Le Human Kebab

I will retreated all northern forces south to help the Crossbow men and southern soldiers to kill the trapped 2k of enemy soldiers, in that 400 crossbow men will fire at those who cross the river or at still trapped on the other side while the 500 spearmen will easily pick off enemy on the riverside as the enemy would be tired from swimming. But that is not all , the retreating forces will create a defensive line on the smaller beachside of the river to the beach, that line would consist of 600 pirates and 350 spearmen while 450 pirates will cross the river to help fill up the army ranks

# If scenario tactics

If the enemy decides to go over the bridge, the northern troops will also back south but will focus on building the bridge or rain fire with their arrows from bows (Junge Rangers) and Crossbows (Pirates). If there is too much of the enemy charging over the bridge, the southern troops will pull back into the jungles. And will wait until the enemy comes to regroup with the trapped survivors, so they again can become human sandwiches as the bridge should make easy access for west river side troops to cross and expand the numbers. Then the same tactics with northern troops coming from south bridge while southern troops closing in from the north side and the jungle, while a small group goes to destroy the bridge.
