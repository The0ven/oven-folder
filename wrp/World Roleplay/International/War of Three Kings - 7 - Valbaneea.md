**Verdant Flag Waves**
*The Xamenli have not been a particularly offensive power. Rather, it prefers stealthy movements and non-traditional tactics to fight upon dense jungles upon the [[Selfalora]]n continent. Most of [[Xamenlia]]n forces are trained and skilled archers; albeit, there remains an underutilized force in Xamenlia.

*Through the thick forests, it wades into coastal areas that have greater mobile abilities. An unexpected adversary makes loud noise upon sand and soft grass south, boasting a boisterous trumpet.*

*4,500 skilled archers, 2,000 crossbowmen, and 2,000 general infantry that use spears and maces go into the jungle-r areas of [[Navarre]] utilizing a tactic of steady attacks by using the density to their advantage. 6,000 skilled archers, 1,200 infantry, and 500 war elephants go down the more coastal and temperate areas of Navarre.*

**The Murder Arrives**
*A loss at Xerelan and Sjever. Although sparsely populated, the loss of those cities signified the near-loss of [[Riveria]]. We cannot stand here and take no action, well, Mavatas cannot. He has shown less capability of a leader yet such a pivotal moment requires respect for the military. Mavatas would finallt make a stand and enter the front lines.

*Mavatas was a strict military leader, gaining the title the “Divine Demon” as it seemed his presence was greater than any other to the military. He would use strict tactics too, making not hasty and brash decisions but still realizing that a decision beat be made quickly. He would bring upon 15,000 infantry and 3,000 heavy infantry to Riveria.*

*He would send the brunt of his forces, 11,000 men (1,500 armored) toward the central conflict at Xerelan hoping to catch the [[Trifarix Legion]] by surprise with numbers and hoping that they had been exhausted, trying once again to corner them at the [[Maris River]].*

*The remaining 7,000 men (1,500 armored) would make march to [[City of Maris]], assistance of water oxen to traverse the river firstly. He would split his army to a large group making an expected attack by the Maris river (4,000 men, 900 armored) and making an unexpected attack from the side to the jungle*
