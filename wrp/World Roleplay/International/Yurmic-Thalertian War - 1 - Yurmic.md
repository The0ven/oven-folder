[[Thernik Union]]
_The Erkart Defensive Line: The Erkart Defensive Line will be created to try and protect the northern border from Thalertian attacks, but due to the heavily jungledness of old Thernch the defensive line might have a hard time defending the north. (Also the areas around the X's are the most defended) The Upper Thalert Offensive: This offensive will try and take small villages around the region of the offensive to slowly crawl up the rivers coast in the north. The Terik Defensive Line: Has basically the same orders as the northern defensive line, try to defend the land from attacks if possible. The Lower Thalert Offensive: Sam orders as the Northern offensive but in the south._
