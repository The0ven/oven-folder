# A Persistent Thorn
*The war carts trundled along the rough jungle road, the troops sitting with their backs pressed against the tall walls of the cart. Dhananjay's cart was near the back, with an extra layer of protection in the form of a thatch covering. So far, the journey had been safe over the first two days, the only threats being small ambushes that were easily thwarted. Now though, Dhananjay was nervous. It was too quiet. They were slowly getting deeper into the jungle as they moved south, chasing the retreating Yurmic armies. Today the tree cover was dense enough that the roads were partially shrouded in darkness all day, the only light coming when they reached a rocky outcropping, clearing, or small village. Dhananjay's train of thought was suddenly interrupted by a series of thunks. Immediately, the soldiers began to grab their weapons and throw off their cloaks to deal with the ambush, but this was unlike the first few. Arrows poured out of the trees like a wave, cutting down a number of the troops as they dismounted. Worse yet, the whining of horses filled the air. Dhananjay looked out from his cart, just in time to see a few of the horses take off in various directions, bleeding from arrows stuck in their sides. Further ahead, horses lay, some of their carts overturned. Dhananjay felt sick, how could his plan be failing! He slammed against one side of his cart, overturning it as well as shielding him from the left flank of archers. By this point, many of his forces had dismounted and were taking cover around their carts. The arrows died down for a moment and the entire army lept up, rushing to both sides. The arrow fire resumed quickly, injuring some, but the numbers were to Dhananjay's advantage. He charged into the dense tree cover, arrows ricocheting from his armour, as his halberd danced through the air. He slashed through one archer, then another. The Yurmic were poorly armoured, some wearing simple tunics and his blade cut through them like butter. As soon as the Thalert forces met the archers, it was over. They had no way to fight back, their bows no longer effective. Some made an effort to fire off the last of their arrows, but the close quarters and the fact that their allies were now in the same line of fire as their enemy made this ineffective. Many dropped their bows and ran into the jungle rather than face the Thalert, a few even surviving, but most were slaughtered en masse. However, once the fighting had settled and Dhananjay was taking stock of his men, the results became grimmer. They were now partially stranded, the horses mostly killed or escaped, they had lost many men in the initial fray, and their enemies had no supplies of not to scavenge. Dhananjay was at a loss...*
