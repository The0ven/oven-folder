[[Bottanic's Recompense - 1 - Bottanic]]
[[Bottanic's Recompense - 1 - Nanacatl]]

## Result:

`The Advance Scouts`

*Israel IV has commanded the Shamanic Guard to infiltrate past the [[Bottanic Kingdom]]'s' defensive line to gather forward information for the main army. Under the twilight the guard skulks along the river banks, spreading into the Battanic jungles. The scouts are able to avoid detection throughout the night and especially in the north manage to scout out the locations of the major defensive constructions dotted along the border. However, while returning to relay the information, some scouts in the south are spotted by the defensive line, leading to their capture and the lighting of pyres to communicate between the forts that an attack was imminent...*

`Carnage Among the Leaves`

*With information in hand, the [[Nanacatl]] forces begin their assault on Bottanic. Their initial obstacle to the homeland is the large river which separates the two nations. The Nanacatl green water navy enters this central river and bridges are constructed to facilitate the crossing, though elephants are able to cross without the need for such infrastructure. As the troops begin to move west into the jungle they are constantly pestered by arrows and raiding parties which disappear back into the jungle as rapidly as they appear. Although these do not deal devastating damage to the troops they do allow unwanted casualties and the destruction of some supply carts.*

*After about an hour's march, the troops reach the line of border forts constructed by the Bottanic and are forced to engage with the armies. Here the troops which pestered them throughout the march now emerge in full force, working with the main defensive troops to lead the Nanacatl army into denser terrain and quicksand traps. The elephants do prove effective in trampling through the jungle and do manage to destroy some units of raiders but ultimately prove slow and large targets which makes them vulnerable to the Battanic spears which focus on disabling the legs of the beasts.*

*The Nanacatl armies make little progress for some time, unable to besiege the forts properly as they try and set up tents but are constantly harassed. The following days bring many losses to the army and worst of all their food supplies in the northernmost regions dwindle as they are constantly attacked and the most difficult to resupply. There is hope however, as the Nanacatl navy cements its control over the river regions and helps the north break a few forts along the river.*

`Not All Is Lost?`

*The campaign has been mostly quite trying for the Nanacatl, save for one front. In the very north, the troops are able to advance sooner as no scouts were discovered and there was no need to construct bridges. In addition, the navy has cut off this small exclave from the Battanic core territory, creating an effective siege of the entire region. As the troops advance, they are still harassed but with less advance knowledge of their arrival, the Battanic raiders falter. The army continues to advance and reaches the line of forts, beginning their siege. Due to comparably smaller area they are better able to coordinate between them to defend against the raiders. Here the Battanic forces take repeated casualties both in battle and failed raids, although they do some damage to the advancing force it is not enough. The fort line falls and the troops continue to advance. Eventually the peninsula in its entirety is taken and the forts used to hold captured soldiers. The supplies from the region reinvigorate the army as they are brought across the river to aid the northern troops, who are once again ready to advance...*
