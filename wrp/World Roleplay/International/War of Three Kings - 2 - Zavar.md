 - **Action A** 
    Because pirates have crossbows, it will give them good accuracy then a simple tokakian bow, so by cutting down few logs of woods, and those pirates who have shields will cover those dig up few trenches and covers for crossbow men to fire rain down onto Valbaneans, if they try to cross the river, and come near second side of the shore, The Crossbow men will push down the logs to roll onto the riverside at river-crossing enemies. Then they will be supported by long spearmen of Jungle Rangers with their heads covered with shields wielded by Pirates. (1k crossbow men, 800 shields with long swordsmen, 2k spearmen) If they dont cross or cross the river, the second plan in motion will be to send Jungle Rangers to cross the river little bit south, while the crossbow men distract the enemies, Jungle Rangers (literally in the name) are specialised in moving through thick jungle so around 600 of them will cross the river and try to sneak towards the flank of the enemy.
- **Action B**
    This one is more risky but takes place after crossbowmen managed to make some progress at the small hidewall with longs and shields, and if Jungle rangers already made their way to the ambush spot. Then the Southern Crossing starts, carried out by 2k Pirates, 1k spearmen, in the same time northern starts with 1.5k pirates and 1k spearman cross at the northern side, as they will be covered by arrow fire from 1k crossbow men who at their disposal also have their common long sword but also 500 guys with shields and 400 spearmen who stayed behind.
    Many soldiers will die at the river crossing but enough will pass to the other side, if the enemy sees the opportunity to come more near the beachside to slay the river crossers, they will be shot down by crossbow men and then the ambush spearmen will charge from the flank and stab through with their spears. If they can't push through enough, they can return back into the jungle, baiting the heavy enemies to get stuck in the thick bushes against light armour and agile spearmen. If The ambush flank works, the surviving spearmean from river crossing will move up the riverside and try to form another flank while pirates charge through with their shields and long swords.
