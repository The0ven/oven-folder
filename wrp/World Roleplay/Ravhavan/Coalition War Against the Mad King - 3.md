**Plan:** While the advance has slowed, we have seen great success across the war so far. After reaching out to negotiate with the new Valente government and being so fiercely declined, we must double down in our efforts and ensure our defenses strong against any counter attack. The Csarian front (Orange) will move in force the northern coast heavily as the Valente fleet is now confined to the central bay. The Southern front (Red) will be reinforced to its original strength with troops from the homeland coming over along with 1 [[Csarian Empire]] infantry from the southern front as well as the Ravhavan Infantry. The Southern front will launch a large scale offensive to capture as much land as possible through the desert, and reach the coast where the Csarians will be forced to fall back to their coastal cities. This will combine with the southern wing of the Central front (Blue to connect together the two advances better. The majority of the Central front will be focused on defending and minimizing casualties, but will continue to slowly advance if uninhibited. The Northern front (Green) will execute a charge south west to cut off all land routes between the peninsular forces and the central Valente forces. They will then establish a strong defensive front with the peninsula and the central body to ensure we do not get pushed back. A new force of 2 Standard Ravhavan infantry will be dispatched from the homelands to begin besieging the northern cities in Valente (dark blue). This force will focus on using battering rams and siege towers to scale walls into the coastal cities and capture them while refraining from harming civilian populations. Once these cities are successfully captured the invading force will act as garrisons, while unneeded troops will return home or reinforce the northern and central fronts to make up for losses.
