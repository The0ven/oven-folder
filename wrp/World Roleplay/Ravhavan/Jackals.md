A group of scrupuous criminals who used to operate throughout [[Awalentse]]. After the crack downs on their operations by Ravhava they mainly function within [[Tsecho]], however they maintain an intelligence network spread throughout the protectorate and even into the [[Csarian Empire]]'s possessions on the peninsula. Following the [[Tusc Accord]], their power greatly expanded across the power vacuum in Awalentse, but then [[Rek]] [[Tchankh]] and [[Tsawb]] oversaw the collapse of organized crime in the protectorate. During this process, Tsawb made various dealings with the Jackals, partially merging them into the [[Grain & Livestock Guild]].
