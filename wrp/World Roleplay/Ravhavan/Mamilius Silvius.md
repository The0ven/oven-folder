Count and harbour master of [[Venian]]. Rose to prominence during the pre war period of valente, but retired just before the onset of the war. Following the [[Tusc Accord]], he was granted dominion over the northernmost tip of Awalentse, although he rarely sees much happen around the isolated town. Rather, he ensures the state is properly equipped for both naval and land defense. He also develops designs for new ships to be used throughout the union which he tests in the north sea.
