[[_Ravhavan Union]]

Leader of the [[Elh]] tribe and ruler of [[Knus]]. A skilled diplomat, Mvata has been key in the relations with the [[Xie]] and [[Da Chu]]; as well as being the first contact with [[Meridia]]. She is at times both a close friend and political rival of [[Emira]], as they differ on their vision for Ravhava.
