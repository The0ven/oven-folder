[[_Ravhavan Union]]

Winged horsemen formed by the most elite of the [[Ibni]] riders, skilled in archery and melee both mounted and on foot. Extremely adaptable soldiers with great skill in wilderness survival, stealth, and hand to hand combat. They have developed their own form of martial arts known as Aikey which is focused on rendering opponents unconscious through a combination of chokes and strikes. They are extremely effective in desert terrain but also train in high altitude mountains, dense forest, and coastal cities to hone their skills to any situation. They wear decorative winged armour and are most commonly dressed in gold, red, and black colours. They are often used as an expeditionary force for Ravhavan interests outside of the [[Khetsi desert]]. Each member is assigned a home in [[Ves]] for their families where they stay during times of peace.
