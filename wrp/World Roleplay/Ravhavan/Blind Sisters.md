[[_Ravhavan Union]]

Priests/Nuns of Yucka, born blind due to unknown birth defect, extreme sense of hearing, seen as aspects of [[Ngok]], as they are best able to hear the word of [[Klah]]. Live all over the Union but the largest groupings are in [[Knus]], where they guard the mausoleum and provide healing services, and [[Cach]], where new members of the order are trained in Ngokic medicine.
