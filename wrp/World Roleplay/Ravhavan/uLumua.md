A legendary soldier hailing from [[Ves]], uLumua was the pride of the [[Ibni]]. He learned strategy from [[Tchankh]] and as such has a penchant for playing mind games with his opponents. He believes in the strength of the Ibni and the [[Aiker Corps]] as surgical weapons for precise attacks, while the greater army exists as a force for occupation and the occasional even battle. He uses logistics and raiding as great force multipliers and has repeatedly liaised with the [[Xie]] and [[Da Chu]] during the [[Zhao Civil War]].
