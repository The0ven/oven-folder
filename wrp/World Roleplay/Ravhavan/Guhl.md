"Limbo", "Purgatory", "The In-Between"; Guhl has many names, but it has one truth. It is where souls reside between lives. The dead come here and are prepared for the next life by the first prophet [[Haghba]], the only non-dead resident of Guhl. The arbitration of lives is based on the past life and the evaluation often takes mere moments. As such, Haghba has become very lonely and committed himself to continuing his work exploring mysticism and material philosophy while he is there. [[Neung]] visited Guhl during his struggle against [[Ngtsu]] ([[Prophetic Return]]). There he worked with Haghba do defeat the deity.
