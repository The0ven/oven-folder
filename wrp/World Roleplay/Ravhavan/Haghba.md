[[_Ravhavan Union]]

HAGB•A - /ˈhɒgbʌ/
Prophet of the Ravhavan faith, spoke the word of [[Klah]], healed and grew as [[Ngok]] had, was sturdy as [[Puhl]], and moved with the grace of [[Ngtsu]]. Born in [[Name]] and travelled to [[Cach]] where he gave sermons and healed the sick. One day he began a journey to [[Knus]] where he paved the way for the earliest caravans crossing the entire [[Khetsi desert]]. Upon arriving in Knus he waded into the water at sunset and was never seen again. Some artifacts remain from his death that he had placed on the shore. This is why all leaders of Ravhava are entombed in the great mausoleum at Knus. His greatest achievement was authoring the [[Klim Chak]] the most holy book of Yucka. A second volume was rumored to have been created in the years leading up to his death but it has never been found. He was known to wear a toga-like robe of dark grey linen.
