The lands are split into three distinct regions, the [[Khetsi desert]], the [[Dragon's Spine Mountains]], and the coast. Through the desert runs the [[Mse river]]. Within the mountains is the important holy site of [[Name]] where humans are thought to originate. Along the river is the settlement of [[Cach]] where the prophet [[Haghba]] gave his sermons. In the south is the [[Frem Peninsula]], a huge point of trade for the Southern Elh and the terminal stop of the great journeys across the Khetsi.
