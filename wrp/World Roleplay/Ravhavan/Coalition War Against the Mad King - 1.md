**Advantages:** Larger force, Elite cavalry, Extreme terrain advantage, technology, desert tactics/training, surprise/little defences, powerful siege equipment **Disadvantages:** Defensible cities along coasts, Home field/Local support.

**Plan:** We have long ignored the Valente to our west and our pacts of mutual protection have stood long over the years. However, the paranoia of the king DeRosa has worried the Union on the stability of the Valente leader. Wanting to ensure the security of the region we will coordinate with the Csarians to the realm of the mad king. Our massive steel industry has powered both our and our island ally's war efforts, the [[Csarian Empire]] ships gleaming with steel rams and fixtures across their hulls as the Ravhavan camels reflect rays across the desert sands from their lightweight steel armour. Our focus for the first attack is to take the Valente by surprise from our border with them and force their armies to be split and forced to retreat to the coasts. To do this we will focus on driving through the center of the desert and raiding towns and camps throughout the area, using small scouting parties on horseback to track enemy troop movements. The armies are grouped into smaller regiments which can be deployed all together or as individual forces based on the size of the enemy they are engaging and the area the engagement is taking place. Our main tactics will focus on traditional techniques using our highly trained infantry in a phalanx to advance on an enemy, and our heavy cavalry to flank and trap enemy forces. We will try and minimize casualties on our end and also always allow the Valente to retreat or route when they try to rather than slaughter routing troops. Ideally this move will trap the Valente troops along the coast and cut off their supply lines through the desert.
