One story from the perspective of [[Tchankh]], consul and magistrate of [[Awalentse]]. One walla dedicated to the explanation of governance and investment in the region. 
# Plots
- [x] [[A Hard Day's Work]] - Focus on building infrastructure, expanding road networks along the peninsula. [[Elh]] trade networks expanded across the entire peninsula. Governance is hands off, with the Consul acting in a supporting role. Although, due to the inefficacy of the government he is able to exert much more influence than intended.
- [x] [[Backroom Dealings]] - Tchankh visits multiple connections across Awalentse, preparing for a coming meeting. There, he uses the intel to strongarm the ruler into agreeing to increasing [[Grain & Livestock Guild]] control in the region as they are sponsoring the infrastructure. Criminals are all destroyed save for one group, which is more or less restricted to operate in [[Tsecho]]
