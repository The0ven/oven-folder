A dish of grilled cactus flesh, wrapped in a thin wheat flatbread. Seasoning varies by region, the [[Awalentse]] eating it most commonly with plain sea salt and fermented cactus. It is only common in the desert, as Cactus is rare near the mountains, and is therefore mostly only eaten by the [[Ibni]].
