Once a captain of the Ravhavan navy, Wheonik retired not long after [[The Great War]]. He had a peaceful retirement for about a year before being contacted by the newly empowered [[Grain & Livestock Guild]]. [[Tsawb]] offered him an unrebukable contract as the admiral and overseer of all guild naval forces, both in the peacetime protection of trade and any possible war. He would only return to the helm after a few years when the [[Awalentse Civil War]] broke out and he left the management desk to take to the seas.
