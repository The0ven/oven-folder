One story from the perspective of [[Lucius Rufinius]], one walla about the sides in the war, written as a message entry of [[Tchankh]] back to Ravhavan council. 
- [x] [[Fit for a King]] - Lucius is almost of age and his court has confined him to the oasis palace [[Tarkin]] to protect him from assassins rife in [[Jersan]]. A short bit about daily life in the palace, then Tchankh arrives in a rush to inform the prince king that [[Vedius Dalmaticus]] is planning to make a play for the capital. A missive arrives later from [[Tsawb]] informing the prince that he stands with the monarchy at the moment and the [[Grain & Livestock Guild]] will defend its territory should a war erupt.
- [x] [[A Cast of Characters]]
	- Ravhavan Military - Mostly neutral zones, mostly areas with majority Ravhavan population or overwhelming Ravahavan military presence
	- Vedius Dalmaticus & The Republic - Landed gentry and nobles desiring more power and the deposition of the monarchy, relatively strong but also corrupt, controls some of the north and most of the center, fighting over Jersan at the outset of the war. Aligned somewhat with the church and council, tolerates but dislikes the G&LG, hates the Ravhavans and Monarchy
	- Lucius Rufinius & The Monarchy - Status quo faction, the monarchy supported by Ravhava for the most part. Aligned somewhat with the church and the G&LG, does not care about the council and hates the republicans
	- Tsawb & The Traders Guild - Very powerful financially and navally, controls most of the merchant fleet and caravans, huge financial reserves but not a ton of men. Tolerates everyone on the surface but does not like the church or republic secretly.
	- Theocratic Volnt - Small faction mostly made of devout followers in the south who congregated in [[Krakzon]] to escape southern conversion following the Tusc accord. Also supported by one fanatic duke in the north who is entirely devoted to the church. Somewhat supports both the republic and monarchy as long as they dont rely too much on Ravhava. Doesn't mind the G&LG as they have invested in church property, dislikes the council, HATES ravhava.
	- Council - Medium size faction of mostly peasantry and tribal leaders banded together in the form of Ravhavan leadership, hates the Republic as they see them as corrupt and fake partisans, neutral with Ravhava but looks up to their systems, dislikes the G&LG and monarchy, likes the church but is not liked back very much.
	- Anarchy - Various tribes, raider groups, mercenaries who will work for the top dollar. Really no allegiances other than some small tribes which would accept protection over money. Hates the church but is ok with everyone else.
	- Csarian - Small occupied zone to ensure security of Csarian southern territories.
