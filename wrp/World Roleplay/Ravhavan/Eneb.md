[[Tribes]]
[[_Ravhavan Union]]

The Eneb are the oldest of the tribes, and seen as the progenitors of the Ravhavan people. They are the most sedentary almost entirely residing in the mountains on the eastern border of the union. The Eneb are lead by an almost mystical figure known as Eneb who is selected through a coming of age journey undertaken by five adolescents selected by the tribes elders on the passing of the last Eneb. The society is essentially split into three major professions, miners, craftsmen, and terrace farmers. There is only a small element of the Eneb who push forwards the culture, mostly in intricate silver and marble designs. The Eneb work closely with all the tribes, providing the Elh with both rest stops along the eastern trade corridor, as well as both luxury and practical wares for them to trade on either end. They provide the Ibni with equipment like armor and weapons as well as providing training grounds high up in the mountains to practice non desert warfare. The Ogol have their largest presence in Eneb settlements, using their vast supplies to create art as well as using the beautiful mountain vistas as inspiration for great works.
