# Burlingam on Edge
*The city of [[Burlingam]] stood on the mouth of the Bersin River, and as such was an extremely important trade port. Over the decades, it had grown into a massive city rivalling even [[Jersan]], but had much more of a focus on trade and commerce. The port was the third largest in Greater Ravhava, and the guild hall one of the central hubs for [[Grain & Livestock Guild]] activity. The bustling neighbourhoods and markets grew and grew into the lively and populous city it was today.*

*When rumours of a civil war began to spread, the G&LG knew they would need a central base of operations. While Jersan was massive and central, they had no way of rivalling the republican and monarchist presences there. Instead, they chose Burlingam. This put them in extreme proximity to the theocracy, the only faction who declared open hostilities against the guild from the onset. [[Tsawb]] figured this could be a strategic play however, as it would bring them into conflict while they were at their strongest.*

*After the first month of fighting, Burlingam was untouched, and Tsawb could not be any happier. He had been receiving daily reports in Jersan sent by Derain Vula, his commander in the city and the second highest general in the Guild. The Valentan man now sat in his war room, a the center of the southern wall. His scouts were reporting that after [[Wheonik]]'s victory in the bay, the religious extremists had turned their attention towards a land attack. Their forces were now nearing the walls. Growing up, Derain had head plenty of stories of the Volnt and their famous paladins. They were men of massive stature, soldier-monks who lived their entire lives in isolated monasteries training for war. Nothing could shake their faith to the church, and they would fight to the last man. Derain shuddered, his men fought for gold and some honour, their allegiances were much less reliable than his enemies'. Rather than let this unfortunate truth trouble him, Derian turned to the massive map of the city sprawled out across the table and examined his defensive strategy.*

*Anneius Salinator was the Volnt of the Valentan church. However, in this moment, he was a warrior. As he marched with his troops towards the city of Burlingam, he steeled his nerves and reminded himself this was in the support of preserving the remnants of his faith. At this point, Ravhavan had become dominant in the south Valente, pushing his people to flee from their homelands to avoid religious pressure from this... Yucka. He hated the word, and all it stood for. And the Guild, they were just Ravhavan puppets, spreading the influence of their masters throughout the lands. Although they claimed to be secular, it was clear to Anneius what was really happening. He returned from his thoughts to the present moment, as he marched along the desert roads with his men. They could just barely make out the city walls and bridges in the distance. Good, Anneius thought, they would be there soon.*

*Over the next few days they arrived on the river bank, setting up their war camp as they prepared how they could attack across this seemingly impassable obstacle. First, the river crossings had been cut off using Burlingam's famous rotating bridges, so they had to cross another way. Then, only about thirty yards beyond the north bank were the heavy stone walls, lined with Guild archers and the city's garrison forces. The volnt had hoped to use his navy to attack the city from its open port and distract them long enough to cross and begin the siege, but after the disastrous attempted ambush that idea was out of the question. Nevertheless, he persisted in his advance towards the city. Now that he was here he had a plan, he just had to wait for the perfect moment...*

*He didn't have to wait long. The next day, as if an act of god, a thunderous rain took up along the coast from afternoon into dusk. The volnt had spent the last few days sending scouts up the river to find a shallow point to cross at, and they had located one only about a half mile east. Anneius and his forces packed up camp and circled around under the cover of darkness. As they approached the city, now from the east, the garrison was still concentrated on the southern wall. The troops prepared their siege ladders, then waited under cover of sand dunes for the ground to solidify, allowing them to charge towards the wall and begins scaling it. As Anneius climbed, the archers on the walls raised the alarm and attempted to hold off his troops. Arrows plinked off his heavy steel armour, and Anneius looked to both sides to confirm his paladins were climbing first, acting as shields against the arrow fire for the infantry. As he reached the top, the Volnt unsheathed his long blade with one hand, the heavy sword weightless in his powerful arms, and swung it across the body of the first archer. The core of his blade was Pelum, a holy metal found in tiny deposits around the more hilly regions, which added a huge weight to the blade. Few outside of the paladins had the strength and discipline to wield it properly, but those who could were a force to be reckoned with on the battle field, as it both cut and crushed. Anneius swung his with great power, bringing it into the side of another archer and sending him tumbling over the edge of the wall.*

*The war room was in chaos. As if by magic, the Volnt's forces had been transported from one side of the river to the south to directly on the east wall. By the time word had reached Derain, the paladins were already on the wall. His archers were being slaughtered as he thought, but it was really all he could do. His heavy troops had sealed off either tower, confining the enemy to the single section of wall but also condemning the archers there to death. He shook his head, he could not think of them now, it was too late. He would avenge them, their deaths would not be in vain. He was already outnumbered, considering his forces were split between Burlingam and [[Amzon]], although he had sent word for them to send reinforcements down. What he really needed was an entire second force, one rivalling that of the Volnt's. For now, all he could do was stall. He scribbled down a note and passed it to a one of the other men in the room, a Jackal, with a few whispered words. Then he grabbed his helm from the table and pulled it over his face, lifting his sword. He pushed open the door of the war room, and joined a group of troops moving east towards the enemy.*

# Saving Grace
*The Valentan Longsword cut through another archer as Anneius hefted it over his shoulder. As he looked around he saw that the enemy were few. He approached the doors of the corner tower penning him in and slammed his shoulder into it. The door didn't budge, and he looked behind him to see that men attempting to breach the other door were met with the same result. For a few moments the Volnt had no idea what to do. Then, archers appeared from the tower rooves. They shot down, but the paladins raised their shields and protected themselves before the arrows could make purchase. Anneius realized something, and ran over to the wall. He grabbed one of the siege ladder and began to pull it up. His paladins followed his lead, some staying back to distract the archers. They quickly moved the ladders and a few paladins climbed to the rooves and attacked the archers. As the Volnt was about to join them, the doors in front of him burst open, toppling two of the ladders. One paladin fell to his back and another, further up the ladder, fell off the wall entirely. The Volnt swung around and tried to hold back the garrison forces.*

*Derain emerged through the doorway, sword and shield in hand, attacking the theocratic forces. The Volnt was surrounded by his paladins, forming a ring structure that was nigh impenetrable. Instead, the other theocratic forces were engaged with the garrison forces, now better armed than the weak archers. However, it was clear there was no chance of victory. Even as Derain cut through one of the Volnt's infantry, two more climbed up onto the wall. The garrison was heavily outnumbered, especially with the continued casualties incurred. So Derain quickly turned and called for his troops to retreat, but found some paladins had made their way through the tower from the roof and had come up behind them. They fought hard, and some paladins were slain, but quickly they were surrounded by the massive men in steel armour. Derain's men were cut down from all angles, and suddenly he was face to face with the Volnt himself. He attacked Anneius, but the man's armour effortlessly deflected his blade sending his arm out and causing him to fall to his knees. The Volnt drove the top of his foot into his ribs, sending him onto his back with a crunch. Pain shot through his chest as he felt his bones fracture. Wincing in pain, he stretched out his arm towards his sword in an act of desperation, grasping at the hilt with his fingers but the Volnt brought his heel down hard on Derain's wrist, shattering it. In one last hope, he tried to clamber to his feet, but the Volnt drew back his fist and struck him hard on the side of the skull, and everything went black...*

*As Derain faded back into consciousness, he couldn't feel anything. His chest felt as though it was filled with gravel and his arm was limp. He felt his own blood pooling around his face, and as he pulled his face from the ground he realized he could only open one eye, the other offering him only blackness after being struck by the Volnt. He pulled himself to the half wall of the walkway atop the defences, using his good arm to pull his body upright as he used the wall for support. He looked out over Burlingam, and saw the damage that had been done. Smoke rose from the guild hall, as well as buildings along the main road down to the harbour. However, the harbour was where he was filled with renewed hope. Ships flying Nalkan flags sat in harbour, the mercenary reinforcements had arrived. With a smile, Derain rested his head on the lip of the wall and faded back to sleep.*
### Casualties:
**G&LG:**
> 620 Archers
> 2,180 Infantry
> 300 Nalkan Mercs
**Volnt:**
> 18 Paladins
> 2,600 Infantry
### Result:
The success of the theocracy was extremely short lived, and the destruction of the southern army is a **Considerable Loss**. However, this was also an intense defeat for the guild, only being saved thanks to their considerable finances. The fall of Burlingam, though temporary, is a **Considerable Loss**. However, the capture of the Volnt is considered a **Minor Victory**, and as a silver lining they may now decide what to do with him. 

# Communications Breakdown
*The camp was growing restless, there had been no movement in weeks. The republican forces had been gathering and building up since the attempted raid on their camp, but the attack on the palace itself was continuingly delayed by the commanders. Zeldane was unbothered, but it was clear his companions were. He was sitting around a fire with the rest of his troops, talking as they finished their dinner and the sun set. There were whispers that lines of communication back to Jersan had broken down, and without orders from the magistrate no one knew what to do. As his squad mates spoke, Zeldane remembered his time in the Valentan war. Even the well organized national army had repeatedly had communication failures that had lead to their defeat at the hands of the Ravhavans. However, he remained in his belief of the Republican command. Surely even without proper communications the leaders were experienced and intelligent enough to build plans on their own. Who knows, surely not him. Zeldane shook his head, who was he, an illiterate, to question the appointed officers of the new republic.*

"So, what is the plan? Do we just keep waiting for reinforcements? How do we even know they are still coming? We have no word from Jersan, no word from [[Amedial]], we have not even heard from [[Gratian]] or [[Chekian]]. What can we even do?"

"We have the men here already, the monarchists in [[Tarkin]] surely cannot be of greater number than us, and the so called great Royal Guard have already failed to defeat our forces, even in an ambush, we should begin raids on the castle to weaken them."

"No, we were told to await further orders, they must be coming, our operation is paramount to the ending of this war."

*Meval sat in the corner of the war room, watching as his fellow commanders bickered like confused children. He was growing tired of the incessant arguing, causing the continual stalemate on the edge of the palace. He had had enough. He stood up and pushed towards the congregation of generals.*

"Thats enough! All of you! You argue back and forth, about orders and men and strategy. Come on now, are you all children? We must strike while the iron is hot, Tarkin has no connection not monitored by us, they have no way to recover from their disastrous raid. If we march on them today, they will fall. We have nothing to fear from the weak enemy. Come now, gather the men tomorrow and we will end this war now, the magistrate will laud us and the nation will sing our praise for all time!"

*[[Lucius Rufinius]] sat in the palace war room, watching as the garrison command for the city, the head of the royal guard, and his chief military advisor discussed the defense of the palace. It had been weeks since their failed raid, and the palace and town had been constantly on edge waiting for the inevitable attack from the south. However, none had come. Lucius watched with interest as the three men intensely discussed strategies, he was more engaged in this than he ever had been in his classes. They were discussing what to do and how they could possibly resupply from north west, when the boy stood and interjected.*

"What if we ask the Ravhavans, they already operate the camel caravans across the [[Khetsi desert]] without need for roads, and their campaign through the desert against the old Valentan army was successful. All we would need is to contact [[Tchankh]]."

*The advisors paused as the prince spoke, hearing the young man out. They looked between each other, then back to him.*

"Perhaps... perhaps this is not such a bad idea... Ravhava has pledged their support to our cause, and they have no reason to support the republic or the theocracy-"

*The advisor cut off the royal guardsman mid sentence.*

"Where is Tchankh though, we have not heard from him since the start of the war, nor has anyone. Sure, we are cut off, but [[Tsawb]] has managed to get letters to us, although with great difficulty."

*The men continued to discuss the possibility of Ravhavan help, and the prince chimed in with ideas, but the thought stuck in the back of his head. Where was Tchankh????*
# Crusader Kings
*Lucius wandered around the castle in the morning, looking for one of his cooks to make him breakfast. The entire air of the palace had shifted since the start of the war, no longer was it a stark and empty citadel for him to wander with a few servants, but now it played host to the entire royal guard as well as levies from the town of Tarkin proper. The troops slept in cots lining the dining hall, and the kitchen staff were doubled in size to meet capacity. However, they still found time to serve the prince. This morning however, the halls were empty, echoing Lucius' voice as he called out. He found the kitchen, and one lone cook greeted him.*

"Why hello Luciun, good morning, would you like your usual breakfast?"

"Y-yes please, but also, where is everyone? The cots are all empty, and even most of the servants are gone. Has something happened?"

*The cook's face dropped and she turned to the counter to mask her dismay at conveying the news. She got to work preparing the food and spoke after a few moments of tense silence.*

"My liege they, well they are off at the walls, the scouts spotted republican troops moving down the road near dawn and well, they have begun to siege the walls. Worry not, the royal guard will surely best the scoundrels who come for you..."

*The woman trailed off as she saw the prince's mouth hanging open, his face reddened with a mixture of anger and embarrassment.*

"You mean to say that my enemy stands at my gate, the enemy who wants to see my head on a pike, and the generals of my own army didn't even bother to wake me and let me know?!"

"W-well sire I am sure it was just their efforts to protec-"

"HOW CAN I BE PROTECTED IF I AM NOT EVEN TOLD I AM IN DANGER!"

*The prince was furious now, but seeing the fear in the cooks eyes he settled.*

"I am sorry, my temper, I am still a child of course please forgive me, you are not the one who has made this decision, simply the messenger of it. I will be in the armoury getting ready when you are finished cooking."

*The woman nodded, silent, as the prince turned on his heel and stormed out of the kitchen towards the armoury. There he found his uncles sword lying on a velvet pillow, and as he lifted it the heavy steel felt somehow familiar in his hand. He blew the dust off it and rubbed it with his tunic, partially restoring it to its once gleaming polished condition. He then hoisted his breastplate over his head and placed it on his own shoulders, before stepping into his greaves. Finally, he picked up the royal helm, a dark grey steel helmet with patterns representing the monarchy burned into the edges. He looked at it as if it was a head, holding the face towards his own, and imagine his ancestors wearing it. Chieftans, princes, kings, lords, all had worn this before him into battle. He sighed and turned it around, lifting it over his head before slowly lowering it as if coronating himself...*



*As Zeldane fought through the militia and royal guards on the ground, it became clear that the republican victory after the ambush had been lucky. His allies all around him were cut down one by one, falling to royal guard and infantry alike. The monarchist heavy cavalry had engaged the small cavalry battalion early on, breaking them and opening up the back flanks of the attackers. Now, the lighter mounted archers circled the skirmish, taking pot shots at denser groups of republican troops. The lightly armoured militiamen were cut down by these shots, but they too returned the attacks by breaking from the fray in lashes to stab at the horses from their underside. Now, the heavy cavalry was waiting off to the east by the walls, perhaps for the right moment to strike definitively. Zeldane processed all these at lightning speed as he fended off an attack from one of the militia men. He pulled his sword up, the tip slicing open the torso of his attacker, before bringing it down and across the two men to his right. He felt a sharp pain in his left shoulder, and swung around, throwing the butt of his sword into the man who had plunged the dagger into his back. The man crumpled in half and fell, but another took his place, and Zeldane realized he was running out of room. Just then, he heard the rumbling of hooves and saw the cavalry charging into the battle. The horses leapt over the monarchist line and swung their blades across both sides, clearing a path through the republicans. As he ducked out of the way of one of their blades, a hoof made contact with the back of his head and his entire world faded to black...*

*Meanwhile, Meval was quickly regretting his decision to make a hasty attack on the palace. Before his very eyes the attack was collapsing, his future crumbling with it. He knew the magistrate did not take kindly to failure or disobedience, and this was both. He needed to win, there was no other way forwards. He cracked his whip, and his heavy cavalry group broke rank from the back lines to engage the enemy's heavy cavalry. The charge was clearly unexpected, and Meval was able to get one over on the royal guard, cutting through any trailing riders. However, the main party quickly swiveled, and the two brigades faced each other down. The charged at the same time, Meval in line with the head of the royal guard as they lead their armies into the skirmish. Meval attempted to place his lance square between the breastplate and leggings of the royal guardsmen, but his opponent shifted at the last minute and the tip hit bare armour. Nevertheless, he redirected his focus to the next man, successfully knocking him from his horse. He pulled on the reigns and readjusted to circle around and execute his prey. Out of the corner of his eye he thought he saw the royal guard captain closing, but he had just passed him, how was that possible. Before Meval could think he stabbed down towards the royal guardsman he'd dismounted, killing him instantly. But then there was a sharp pain in his lower back and his vision blurred as he let go of his lance and was lifted off his horse. Falling face first into the rough sand, he recovered quickly and unsheathed his sword, slashing around blind to try and strike his assailant. Then he saw the royal guard captain before him. The man jumped down from his horse and unsheathed his own blade.*

"You die. Here and now. Your army is defeated, the prince will rule and filth like yourself will never see the light at the end."

*With that, the guardsman charged, and so did Meval. Their blades clashed, the steel clanging loudly. Their hilts bound as both men struggled to overpower the other. Meval gained a slight upper hand, pushing the captains blade out from before him as he thrust his forwards, but the warrior was too quick, lunging as his blade moved and dropping to one knee to avoid the stab. Before Meval could process what was happening the captain wrapped his free arm around his toso and pushed off his bent knee, sending Meval onto his back. His sword fell into the sands, the tip burying down.*

"I told you, your men are untrained and weak. Your fight is over. Surrender while you still have breath and perhaps I will spare you."

"PTAH, I would rather die for the republic than bend the knee to that brat in the palace. He is no warrior, how can you follow him." 

*Meval spat up at the captain, snarling his words. The captain smiled back.*

"That boy is a thousand times the warrior you will ever be. Have it your way. Die for your failed ideas..."

*With that he plunged his sword down, just above Meval's breastplate, piercing his throat and thrusting through to the sand. The republican general's eyes rolled back in his head...*
### Casualties:
**Monarchists:**
> Infantry: 1830
> Cavalry: 210
> Heavy Cavlary: 80
> Archers: 310
**Republicans**
> Infantry: 2480
> Cavalry: 430
> Heavy Cavlary: 110
> Archers: 270

### Results:
While Tarkin is not yet free, as the standard routes out of it are still controlled by Republican forces, the failed siege is a **Considerable Loss** for the republicans. The defense brought hope to the city, and the monarchists as a whole, but the looming threat of the republicans closing in on the isolated palace from the north makes this only a **Minor Victory** for the Monarchists.
