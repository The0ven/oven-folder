### Plan:
#### Purple
Our initial move was an overwhelming success, but we cannot rest on our laurels. Together with Csarian, we will press on along the main roads of the northern coast. First, our camel cavalry (Purple) will adjust their bounds north, focusing on cutting off supply between Ferrihn and the north-east. They will do this by monitoring the roads to Nasihr and  Nimia, plundering any caravans along the routes and mainly focusing on destroying supplies rather than killing troops. These hit and run attacks are made easy by their ability to use compound bows from camelback, as well as their knowledge of the desert and surviving in it. 3 camel regiments will be assigned to each road (ignore purple past the orange arrows i cant edit map). While their supplies are low, we will continue our simultaneous attack into Zahedan and Suelhe-Pasha. 
#### Orange
Zahedan is nestled deep in the desert, so our main force will be the Ibni Infantry(6,912) and Horsemen(1,600) regiments, both of whom are raised being taught desert combat. The camels have been maintaining attacks along the roads, starving the troops stationed in the town. Our hope is that the enemy has overcorrected and moved a large number of troops to the town. If that is the case, the horsemen will pick off troops until we are confident we can take them. There will also be 2 infantry stationed nearby, in case we need to reinforce our line if the enemy launches an attack towards us. Essentially we will besiege the town through our horses, with the infantry there as collateral and the finishing force.
#### Blue + Red 1
The same will be done in Suelhe-Pasha, except with the Csarian forces, 8 of our standard horsemen, and the ground archers. Again, 2 infantry will be stationed just east in case reinforcements are needed. The main difference here will be the naval strike. Our navy will attack the city from the north and prevent any naval escape, while transports ready the reinforcements to arrive. Once ready, 2 Csarian infantry and 2 standard infantry will land along the coast and harbour, attacking the city and cutting off any possible reinforcements along the roads west(blue). 
#### Green/Burgundy
We have intercepted an Iturime messenger travelling to [[Meridia]], requesting their aid in the form of mercenaries. From this we must assume they have sent similar notices to other nations and thus we must prepare to stop this. Before anything else a quarter of the Csarian navy will be sent south to [[Empire of The Horocians]], where we have negotiated rights to dock and supply. The ships will form a choke point between Horocia and [[Idhepirothipa]], ensuring the [[Jangaraja Empire]] cannot send any troops. The ships will also focus on the bay between Iturime and the South East (north part of bigger green), destroying any Iturime ships that try and move troops around the chokepoint created by the mountains. Once the invasion (blue) is successful, another quarter of the Csarian fleet will reinforce this column between Iturime and Horocia, creating a full exclusion zone. In the north the Ravhavan and [[Awalentse]] navies will join the remaining Csarian ships, making up somewhat for the split fleet. The Ravhavan and Awalentse fleets will operate from [[Akna]]'s southern harbour and focus on protecting the coast and scouting and destroying Iturime ships that stray too far from the coasts(Burgundy). Akna's port on the northern side of the [[Frem Peninsula]] provides great strategic value, if the Iturime navy does emerge in full force our ships can retreat into the bay and surround them as they follow. 
#### Red 2
If the other operations have gone well, our troops should have captured Zahedan and Suelhe-Pasha as well maintaining monitoring of the roads to Nashir and Nimia. We will have also intercepted any supplies north either via land or sea, so ideally the enemy has reinforced the city heavily and the troops are now starving. As long as they have not been able to fully reinforce and supply the city we will commit to taking it. The troops from the Suelhe-Pasha siege will march west along the main road, supported by 1 of the camel regiments. Additionally, 2 more standard infantry will join the march. 1 infantry regiment will be sent into Suelhe-Pasha to hold the city and police it. The strategy in Nimia will be the same as this city too lacks walls. Once the cavalry have whittled down the troops and broken their morale, the infantry will enter from every side to crush the remaining force.

#### General
Although the Iturime are our enemy in this war, their people are not. Our policy will be to allow cities to surrender during siege before the infantry assault begins, with the soldiers being promised their lives if they lay down arms. The citizenry will be policed, ensuring they are not rising up against the occupation, but overly strict or harsh policies will not be taken, they will be treated as citizens and awarded the same rights. Similar rules will apply to naval warfare, allowing ships to surrender if surrounded or outnumbered, but we will be more aggressive on the water, seizing supply ships whenever we can. We will also make efforts to reach out to lesser lords of the Iturime and convince them to join our efforts, promising them full control over their own lands, with only a tax and levy in place.
