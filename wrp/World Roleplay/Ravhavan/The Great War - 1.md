**Advantages:** Surprise, Enemy fighting far war, Desert-Mountain-River training, Wargame practice, Elite Corps (Aiker), Massive naval advantage (Csarian), Logistics is [[Elh]], [[Ibni]] train their entire lives for combat, Veterans of the [[Valente War]], Technology ([[Nebian Bow]] carts).

**Disadvantages:** Home advantage, Pyramid-Forts are in very defensible positions

**Plan ([[Csarian Empire]]):** The time has come at last, we can finally rid the west of the Ituri hegemon that has plagued the lands for countless years. We will prove our dominance on land and sea alongside Ravhava. Our navy (GREEN) will commence raids along the northern coast of the Ituri lands. We will use Ravhavan ports as bases of operation for our ships as to not stretch their supply from our home islands. Many of these sailors are veterans from previous wars which gives them more naval experience. Our navy will use both ramming and boarding tactics against the enemy as well as the Nebian bow developed by the Ravhavans. We will also send Csarian forces to the Ravhavan front on land as to help them with pushing against the Ituri.

**Plan (Ravhavan):** While the enemy is down, WE STRIKE! The [[Iturime]] have entered a war against our friends the [[Khoakhram]], who we have promised to defend! Our troops have prepared long for this moment. We will strike south (RED), focusing on capturing the border towns and pressing towards the river. Here, we will deploy pontoon bridges to cross it, and the Eastern Detachment(ORANGE) will break off eastwards. Once across the river, our troops will continue along desert and road to reach the last of the northern-central towns (Suelhe-Pasha in the north, Zahedan centrally, and Waqith the most southern). Beyond these towns the Camel Cavalry(PURPLE) will break off to roam south and capture and control the Iturime supply routes, especially those far north along the southern coast. The cavalry bands will be accompanies by Elh traders, acting as logistics support, and will focus on raiding any forces moving from the south to the north. The journey is too long for one day, so we will focus on attacking their camps at night and burning their tents and supplies before retreating into the cover of darkness and dunes. If the camel troops discover that a large force is heading towards them, they will retreat back to the defensive line (red dotted). Meanwhile, the Eastern Detachment, comprised of the 2 Ibni Infantry and the Aiker Corps (8,192 total) both of whom are elite forces trained in the deserts and mountains, will head east up the river towards the valley to Khoakhram. There, the Iturime house a large cache of supplies and military equipment in the Pyramid-Forts, our goal is to destroy the garrison (6,000) and capture the passage to Khoakhram to protect our allies. While they are nestled in the valley, our forces are extremely elite and should be able to deal with the guards.

**Extra Info:** Csaria has the largest navy in the world to my knowledge with the recent addition of the Valente Navy to that of the Csarian one. Ravhavan and Csarian troops have fought together and trained together for decades.
