**Plan:** _Our initial invasion has been a great success, but we must not lull ourselves into a false confidence and allow our enemies to get the best of us. Our forces are to redouble their efforts, focusing again on capturing the entire central desert area, forcing the valente back to their coastal cities in retreat while our desert cavalry hounds them, withering down the retreating parties. We will also focus on capturing roads along the coasts to cut off the supply and communication between the cities, sowing further confusion and not allowing for the defenders to coordinate their counterattack. One infantry battalion from the northern front will join the centre to reinforce their push. Divide and conquer is the main focus of this advance, however in the south the strategy is slightly different. The Csarians (orange) and Southern front (red) will focus heavily on capturing the land along the river, all the way to the mouth. Casualties will be accepted more along these fronts as a more aggressive advance is desired. If the Valente troops in the south move off of the border with the [[Csarian Empire]] occupation (light purple south) then their troops stationed there will advance in coordination with the Csarians (orange), focusing on capturing the northern coast and creating a pincer against the defending Valente in which they are cut off from their other forces to the north.
