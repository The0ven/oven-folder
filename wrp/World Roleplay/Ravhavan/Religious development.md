	- [x] [[The New Words]] - Neung and Haghba defeat Ngtsu, Haghba explains he is the reason Neung could never peer (he knew he could grow stronger from not peering) and how Neung must now spread his natural philosophy to the masses with the help of the Ghuners, Neung awakes in his room and opens to the first page of the Chak Awr, where he begins to annotate and write his own version. Haghba decides to stay in Guhl, to act as arbiter for reincarnation.
